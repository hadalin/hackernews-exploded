It more than likely contains errors (hopefully not serious ones). Furthermore, its references to the literature are incomplete.  Your comments and suggestions to the author at \ndimitrib@mit.edu \nare welcome. \n\n The purpose of the book is to consider large and challenging multistage decision problems, which can be solved in principle by dynamic programming and optimal control, but their exact solution is computationally intractable. We discuss solution methods that rely on approximations to produce suboptimal policies with adequate performance. \nThese methods are collectively referred to as reinforcement learning, and also by alternative names such as approximate dynamic programming, and neuro-dynamic programming. \n\n Our subject has benefited enormously from the interplay of ideas from optimal control and from artificial intelligence. One of the aims of this monograph is to explore the common boundary between these  two fields and to form a bridge that is accessible by workers with background in either field.\n\n The mathematical style of the book is somewhat different from the author's dynamic programming books, and the neuro-dynamic programming monograph, written jointly with John Tsitsiklis. We rely more on intuitive explanations and less on proof-based insights. Still we provide a rigorous short account of the theory of finite and infinite horizon dynamic programming, and some basic approximation methods, in an appendix. For this we require a modest mathematical background: calculus, elementary probability, and a minimal use of matrix-vector algebra.\n\nThe methods of this book have been successful in practice, and often spectacularly so, as evidenced by recent amazing accomplishments in the games of chess and Go. However, across a wide range of problems, their performance properties may be less than solid. This is a reflection of the state of the art in the field: there are no methods that are guaranteed to work for all or even most problems, but there are enough methods to try on a given challenging problem with a reasonable chance that one or more of them will be successful in the end.\nAccordingly, we have aimed to present a broad range of methods that are based on sound principles, and to provide intuition into their properties, even when these properties do not include a solid performance guarantee. Hopefully, with enough  exploration with some of these methods and their variations, the reader will be able to address adequately his/her own  problem.\n\n \n BOOK PREFACE, CONTENTS, AND CHAPTERS\n \nClick here for preface and table of contents.\n Drafts of book chapters (periodically updated, check for latest versions):  \nChapter 1: Exact Dynamic Programming, \nChapter 2: Approximation in Value Space,\nChapter 3: Parametric Approximation, \nChapter 4: Infinite Horizon Reinforcement Learning,\nChapter 5: Aggregation,\nReferences.\n\n \nClick here for a slide overview presentation from Conference on Decision and Control, Dec. 2018.\n\n\n\n\n REINFORCEMENT LEARNING COURSE AT ASU: SLIDES AND VIDEO LECTURES\n Lecture slides for a course in Reinforcement Learning and Optimal Control (January 8-February 21, 2019), at Arizona State University: \n Slides-Lecture 1, Slides-Lecture 2, Slides-Lecture 3, Slides-Lecture 4, Slides-Lecture 5, Slides-Lecture 6, Slides-Lecture 7, Slides-Lecture 8, \nSlides-Lecture 9, \nSlides-Lecture 10, \nSlides-Lecture 11, \nSlides-Lecture 12, \nSlides-Lecture 13.\n\n Videos of lectures from Reinforcement Learning and Optimal Control course at Arizona State University: (Clisk around the screen to see JUST THE VIDEO, or JUST THE SLIDES, or BOTH SIMULTANEOUSLY).\n Video-Lecture 1, \nVideo-Lecture 2, Video-Lecture 3,Video-Lecture 4,\nVideo-Lecture 5,\nVideo-Lecture 6,\nVideo-Lecture 7,\nVideo-Lecture 8,\nVideo-Lecture 9,\nVideo-Lecture 10,\nVideo-Lecture 11,\nVideo-Lecture 12,\nVideo-Lecture 13.\n\n Lecture 13 is an overview of the entire course.\n\n \n\n\n Dynamic Programming and Optimal Control, Vol. 1, 4th Edition\n Dimitri P. \nBertsekas\n Published February 2017\n\n\n The fourth edition (February 2017) contains a\nsubstantial amount of new material, particularly on approximate DP in Chapter 6.

This is a major revision of Vol. II and contains a substantial amount of new material, as well as \na reorganization of old material. The length has increased by more than 60% from the third edition, and\nmost of the old material has been restructured and/or revised. Volume II  now numbers more than 700 pages and is larger in size than Vol. I. It can arguably be viewed as a new book! \n\n \nApproximate DP has become the central focal point of this volume, and occupies more than half of the book (the last two chapters, and large parts of Chapters 1-3). Thus one may also view this new edition as a followup of the author's 1996 book \"Neuro-Dynamic Programming\" (coauthored with John Tsitsiklis). A lot of new  material, the outgrowth of research  conducted in the six years since the previous edition, has been included. \n\n A new printing of the fourth edition (January 2018) contains some updated material, particularly on undiscounted problems in Chapter 4, and approximate DP in Chapter 6. References were also made to the contents of the 2017 edition of Vol. I, and to high profile developments in deep reinforcement learning, which have brought approximate DP to the forefront of attention. \n\n\nDynamic Programming and Optimal Control, Vol. II: Approximate Dynamic Programming, ISBN-13: 978-1-886529-44-1, 712 pp., hardcover, 2012\n\n\n \n CHAPTER UPDATE - NEW MATERIAL\n Click here for an updated version of Chapter 4, which incorporates recent research on a variety of undiscounted problem topics, including\n\n\nDeterministic optimal control and adaptive DP (Sections 4.2 and 4.3).\n \n\n Stochastic shortest path problems under weak conditions and their relation to positive cost problems (Sections 4.1.4 and 4.4).\n  \n\nAffine monotonic and multiplicative cost models (Section 4.5).\n\n\n\n PREFACE, SLIDES, AND OTHER INFORMATION\n \nClick here for preface and detailed information.\n \nClick here to order at Amazon.com\n\n\nLectures on Exact and Approximate Finite Horizon DP:", "url": "http://web.mit.edu/dimitrib/www/RLbook.html", "hostname": "web.mit.edu", "category": "uncategorized", "comment_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19235028"}, {"title": "The Famous Photo of Chernobyl's Most Dangerous Radioactive Material Was a Selfie ", "description": "At first glance, it’s hard to know what’s happening in this picture.

While it's not finished, we're up to nearly 800 patches, and\nso maintaining it out-of-tree is becoming a bit unruly...and it's in\nsolid enough shape that it could benefit from being in-tree.\n\nI've opened a merge request here:\nhttps://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/merge_requests/283\n\nFor now, Iris will build and install alongside i965 - with i965\nremaining the default driver.  Iris is still considered experimental.\n\nMore details below...\n\n--Ken\n\nWhat is Iris?\n-------------\n\nThe new \"Iris\" driver prototype is essentially our Mesa i965 driver\nreimagined and rebuilt from the ground up.  Our main goal was to make\nthe driver as efficient as possible, aiming for very low CPU overhead.\nWe also decided to drop support for legacy hardware and outdated kernel\ndrivers, freeing us up to design for the future without worrying about\nimpacting the past.  This let us ask, \"if we were doing it all\nagain...what would we want it to look like?\"\n\nWhile designing the new driver, we drew a lot of inspiration from our\nnewer Vulkan driver, as well as a few other Gallium drivers.\n\nKey Changes\n-----------\n\n* All new state upload code is dramatically more efficient.\n\n  In CPU overhead microbenchmarks, Iris can issue on average\n  3 times as many draw calls per second as our i965 driver.\n\n* Supports only Broadwell and newer (Gen8+); drops support for\n  the older Gen4-7.5 GPUs, as well as Braswell/Cherrytrail.\n\n* Updated memory management takes full advantage of modern PPGTT\n  support, allocating VMA in userspace for greater control, and\n  allowing us to pre-bake state containing addresses.\n\n* Requires a modern Linux kernel (v4.16+, could be v4.5 if needed).\n\n* Leverages Mesa's \"Gallium\" driver framework, allowing us to share\n  more code and development effort with the rest of the community.\n\nWhile many pieces are new, much of the driver remains the same.\nWe continue using these components of our existing stack:\n\n* The Mesa OpenGL API front-end\n* The Mesa shader compiler (GLSL, SPIR-V, NIR, i965 Gen-assembly backend)\n* The Intel Surface Layout (ISL) library\n* The Intel Blit-on-Render-Pipe (BLORP) library\n* The i965 auxiliary surface resolve tracker\n* The i965 buffer manager (extended, but largely reused)\n\nQ&A\n---\n\nQ: How do I build and use Iris?\n\nIris only supports the Meson and Android build systems (sorry, no\nAutotools or SCons support).  To build Iris, use -Dgallium-drivers=iris\nwhen running Meson.  -Ddri-drivers=i965 will also build i965.\n\ni965 remains the default driver (assuming it's built).  You can try\nout Iris on a per-application basis by setting an environment variable:\n\n   $ export MESA_LOADER_DRIVER_OVERRIDE=iris\n\nPlease note that Iris requires a modern kernel, such as 4.19+.\n\nQ: Should I use Iris yet?\n\nIris is not considered stable or ready for production use - it's still\nvery experimental.  However, it is largely feature complete (a few less\ncommonly-used features are missing), and is passing roughly 99% of the\nPiglit test suite and OpenGL CTS.  We have not done extensive testing\nor benchmarking of games and applications yet.\n\nIf you're feeling adventurous, feel free to try it out and report\nissues at https://bugs.freedesktop.org/ under product Mesa and the\nDrivers/Gallium/Iris component.  Or ask us on IRC (irc.freenode.net\nchannel #intel-3d).\n\nQ: Are there any known issues?\n\n* Currently, Glamor rendering, and shaders using gl_VertexID, may not\n  work correctly.  This will be fixed shortly after merging.\n\n* GPU reset support is poor - if it hangs, it will likely hang\n  repeatedly until the kernel bans it.  Chris Wilson and I are\n  working on a solution for this.\n\n* There is a known kernel memory leak in some 4.18 kernels, which\n  Iris can provoke.  The fix has already been backported, but a few\n  distros didn't pick it up before moving on to 4.19+.  Please use\n  the latest available kernel.\n\n* Performance is expected to be slower than i965 for the moment, in\n  many cases, but this will improve in the days to come.  There are\n  still a number of stall avoidance paths which have not been hooked\n  up yet, which can lead to the GPU idling.  Fast clears support is\n  missing, and end-to-end color compression is not working yet.\n\n  We expect it to be faster in the long run, and it already is in\n  some particular cases.  For one customer, Iris is 18% faster than\n  i965.  Your mileage may vary until the driver matures a bit more.\n\nQ: What's with the commit history?\n\nThe commit history in this merge request is largely the actual\nnon-idealized history for bringing up the driver, rather than the\ntidy patch series we're used to seeing.  I decided that preserving\nthe history mostly as-is might be of interest to other people who\nare considering bringing up a new driver, to see how I did it.\nAlso, after a year of work, I wanted to be able to fairly attribute\npeople's work, and squashing it would not have done that justice.\n\nDuring development, I rebased the driver on master periodically.\nAt the end, I went back and ensured that the driver would at least\ncompile at each step, so that people can bisect across it without\nas many issues.  I also squashed some obvious fixup commits.  But\nit's largely still the original history.\n\nQ: Who developed Iris?\n\nAccording to git shortlog, the following people contributed patches\nto Iris which made it into the original MR:\n\n    Kenneth Graunke (732)\n    Jordan Justen (14)\n    Dave Airlie (13)\n    Chris Wilson (12)\n    Rafael Antognolli (8)\n    Jason Ekstrand (7)\n    Caio Marcelo de Oliveira Filho (3)\n    Andre Heider (2)\n    Rhys Kidd (1)\n    Sagar Ghuge (1)\n    Tapani PÃ¤lli (1)\n    Timur KristÃ³f (1)\n\nThis understates the work, however, as we've reused a lot of code\nfrom our existing drivers and infrastructure, so my thanks to the\nwhole Intel Mesa team, and the entire Mesa community.  Particular\nthanks to Dave Airlie, Ilia Mirkin, Marek OlÅ¡Ã¡k, and Eric Anholt,\nand others for answering a lot of questions about Gallium.\n\nIn any list of acknowledgments, I am sure to have missed people;\nsorry for the omission, and thank you nonetheless!\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: signature.asc\nType: application/pgp-signature\nSize: 833 bytes\nDesc: This is a digitally signed message part.\nURL: <https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/mesa-dev/attachments/20190220/51f78fed/attachment-0001.sig>\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious message (by thread): [Mesa-dev] [Bug 109532] ir_variable has maximum access out of bounds -- but it's not out of bounds\n\nNext message (by thread): [Mesa-dev] [Bug 109698] dri.pc contents invalid when built with meson\n\n Messages sorted by:\n[ date ]\n[ thread ]\n[ subject ]\n[ author ]\n\n\n\nMore information about the mesa-dev\nmailing list\n", "url": "https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/mesa-dev/2019-February/215576.html", "hostname": "lists.freedesktop.org", "category": "uncategorized", "comment_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19233045"}, {"title": "CRXcavator: Democratizing Chrome Extension Security", "description": "To provide users and IT teams with actionable intelligence about Chrome extensions, Duo Labs is excited to announce the public beta of CRXcavator (rhymes with “excavator”), a free service that analyzes Chrome extensions and produces comprehensive security reports.", "url": "https://duo.com/blog/crxcavator", "hostname": "duo.com", "category": "uncategorized", "comment_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19217035"}, {"title": "Dynamics at the Boundary of Game Theory and Distributed Computing", "description": "We use ideas from distributed computing and game theory to study dynamic and\ndecentralized environments in which computational nodes, or decision makers,\ninteract strategically and with limited information.
