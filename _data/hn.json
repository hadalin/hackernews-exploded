There are many types of polyculture including annual polycultures such as intercropping and cover cropping, permaculture, and integrated aquaculture. Polyculture is advantageous because of its ability to control pests, weeds, and disease without major chemical inputs. As such, polyculture is considered a sustainable form of agriculture.

The term Auftragstaktik was coined by opponents of the development of mission-type tactics. Opponents of the implementation of mission-type tactics were called Normaltaktiker.

They then decide within their delegated freedom of action how best to achieve their missions. Orders focus on providing intent, control measures, and objectives, allowing for greater freedom of action by subordinate commanders.[1] Mission command is closely related to civilian management concept of workplace empowerment and its use in business has been explored by writers such as Bungay (2011) and Tozer (1995, 2012). It is advocated, but not always used,[2] by the militaries of the United States,[3][4] Canada,[5] Netherlands, Australia and the United Kingdom.[6] Mission command is compatible with modern military net-centric concepts,[7] and less centralized approaches to command and control (C2) in general.[8]\n", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_command", "hostname": "en.wikipedia.org", "category": "wiki_article", "comment_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19208850"}, {"title": "William James and the Spiritualist’s Phone | Emily Harnett", "description": "A story of a philosopher, his sister, and belief.", "url": "https://www.laphamsquarterly.org/roundtable/william-james-and-spiritualists-phone", "hostname": "www.laphamsquarterly.org", "category": "uncategorized", "comment_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19205805"}, {"title": "", "description": "", "url": "http://www.bizcoder.com/optimizing-for-the-speed-of-light", "hostname": "www.bizcoder.com", "category": "uncategorized", "comment_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19206791"}, {"title": "LM Playground App", "description": null, "url": "https://lm.sprinkleai.com/", "hostname": "lm.sprinkleai.com", "category": "site", "comment_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19204762"}, {"title": "GPT2 Demo", "description": "Fill in the starting text box with a phrase and let AI autocomplete it for you.", "url": "http://text-gen.simon-mo.com/", "hostname": "text-gen.simon-mo.com", "category": "site", "comment_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19205318"}, {"title": "No, 'Oumuamua is not an alien spaceship.

In the Local Standard of Rest frame (circular Galactic\nmotion), 'Oumuamua is remarkable for showing both negligible radial (U) and\nvertical (W) motion, while having a slightly sub-Keplerian circular velocity\n(V; by ~11 km/s). These calculations strengthen the interpretation that A/2017\nU1 has a distant extrasolar origin, but not among the very nearest stars. Any\nformation mechanism for this interstellar asteroid should account for the\ncoincidence of 'Oumuamua's velocity being so close to the LSR.", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.11364", "hostname": "arxiv.org", "category": "uncategorized", "comment_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19202540"}, {"title": "Project Lyra: Catching 1I/'Oumuamua - Mission Opportunities After 2024", "description": "In October 2017, the first interstellar object within our solar system was\ndiscovered. Today designated 1I/'Oumuamua, it shows characteristics that have\nnever before been observed in a celestial body. Due to these characteristics,\nan in-situ investigation of 1I would be of extraordinary scientific value.\nPrevious studies have demonstrated that a mission to 1I/'Oumuamua is feasible,\nusing current and near-term technologies. However, the anticipated launch date\nof 2020-2021 is too soon to be realistic. In this paper, we demonstrate that a\nmission to 1I/'Oumuamua is feasible at an even later point in time, providing\nsufficient time for developing a spacecraft. Using the OITS trajectory\nsimulation tool, various scenarios are analyzed, including a powered Jupiter\nflyby and Solar Oberth manoeuvre, a Jupiter powered flyby, and more complex\nflyby schemes including a Mars and Venus flyby. With a powered Jupiter flyby\nand Solar Oberth manoeuvre, we identify a trajectory to 1I/'Oumuamua with a\nlaunch date in 2033, a total velocity increment of 18.6 km/s, and arrival at\n1I/'Oumuamua in 2049. With an additional deep space manoeuvre before the\npowered Jupiter flyby, a trajectory with a launch date in 2030, a total\nvelocity increment of 16.2 km/s, and an arrival at 1I/'Oumuamua in 2047 were\nidentified. Both launch dates would provide over a decade for spacecraft\ndevelopment, in contrast to the previously identified 2020-2021 launch dates.\nWe conclude that a mission to 1I/'Oumuamua is feasible, using existing and\nnear-term technologies and there is sufficient time for developing such a\nmission.", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.04935", "hostname": "arxiv.org", "category": "uncategorized", "comment_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19204914"}, {"title": "Is 'Oumuamua an interstellar spaceship?
