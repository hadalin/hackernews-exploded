I am sorry to say that our employer knuckled under, and\nso did we, and we replaced that version of the paper with another, without the\noffending citation.  I think my judgments on Wolfram and his works are\naccurate, but they're not disinterested.\n\nWith that out of the way: it is my considered, professional opinion that\nA New Kind of Science shows that Wolfram has become a crank in the\nclassic mold, which is a shame, since he's a really bright man, and once upon a\ntime did some good math, even if he has always been arrogant.\n\nAs is well-known (if only from his own publicity), Wolfram was a child\nprodigy in mathematics, who got his Ph.D. in theoretical physics at a tender\nage, and then, in the early and mid-1980s, was part of a wave of renewed\ninterest in the subject\nof cellular automata.  The\nconstant reader of these reviews will recall that these are mathematical\nsystems which are supposed to be toy models of physics.  Space consists of\ndiscrete cells arranged in a regular lattice (like a chess-board, or a\nhoneycomb), time advances in discrete ticks.  At each time, each cell is in one\nof a finite number of states, which it changes according to a preset rule,\nafter examining the states of its neighbors and its own state.  A physicist\nwould call a CA a fully-discretized classical field theory; a computer\nscientist would say each cell is a finite-state transducer, and the whole\nsystem a parallel, distributed model of computation.  They were introduced by\nthe great mathematician John von Neumann in the 1950s to settle the question of\nwhether a machine could reproduce itself (answer: yes), and have since found a\nproductive niche in modeling fluid mechanics, pattern formation, and many kinds\nof self-organizing system.\n\nAfter the foundational work of von Neumann and co., there was a long fallow\nperiod in the study of CAs, when publications slowed to a trickle, and people\nwere more likely to think of themselves as studying the statistical mechanics\nof spin systems, or the ergodic properties of interacting particle\nsystems, than cellular automata as such.  The major exception was a popular CA\ninvented by John Conway, the Game of Life, or just Life, which spawned a\ndedicated following, trying to fathom how such a ridiculously simple set of\nrules could produce such monstrously complicated results.  In the late 1970s,\nmathematicians and physicists began to become increasingly interested in CAs as\nsuch, largely owing to the advent of (comparatively) cheap and powerful desktop\ncomputers, which let people simulate and visualize CAs.  There was a school of\nthought — obscure, but surprisingly widely known — which, following the\nphysicist Ed Fredkin, thought that the universe as\na whole might in some sense be a CA.  Many people participated in this\nrevival, in many places — prominent names include, alphabetically,\nCrutchfield, Durrett, Farmer, Frisch, Goles, Grassberger, Liggett, Margolus,\nPackard, Toffoli, Vichniac, etc.\n\nWolfram's first paper on CAs, published in 1983, was titled\n\"The\nStatistical Mechanics of Cellular Automata\".  It focused its attention on\nparticular simple — he said \"elementary\" — CAs: one spatial dimension, two\npossible states for each cell, and a neighborhood consisting of the sites to\nthe immediate right and left of a given cell.  There are 8 possible\nconfigurations for such neighborhoods, and so 256 possible elementary CA rules;\nin the paper, Wolfram introduced a useful scheme for referring to those rules,\nand others, by number, so that we speak of rule 18, rule 22, rule 90, rule 110\n(of which much more below), etc.  Beyond that, the paper largely consisted of\ncalculating the entropy of configurations generated by different rules, and\nsaying that, while the rules were simple, the patterns they could generate were\ncomplicated and intriguing.  Well, and so they were; and so said many other\npeople at the first major modern conference on CAs, organized by Farmer,\nToffoli and Wolfram at Los Alamos in 1983.\n\nWolfram went on to publish a bunch more papers on CAs over the next few\nyears: probably the most noteworthy are\n\"Computation\nTheory of Cellular Automata\" (1984), where he used a familiar device of\nelementary computer science (regular languages and their equivalent finite\nautomata) to characterize the set of configurations it is possible for a CA to\nproduce, and\n\"Universality\nand Complexity in Cellular Automata\", where he proposed a four-fold\nclassification of CAs based on their long-run behavior.  Class I decay to a\nfixed, static configuration; class II to periodic oscillation; class III to\nseething, pseudo-random, chaotic gurp; class IV were supposed to have\ncomplicated ordered structures interacting in odd ways, and never really settle\ndown.  This scheme was popular for a while, but no one (including Wolfram) was\never able to make it any more precise, and it's proved basically worthless for\nunderstanding what CAs do; it was a Nice Try.  (For more on the problems with\nthis scheme, see Lawrence Gray's\nreview of this book\n[PDF].)\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Wolfram had a position at the University of\nIllinois-Urbana's Beckman Institute for complex systems.  While there, he and\ncollaborators developed the program Mathematica, a system for doing\nmathematics, particularly algebraic transformations and finding exact-form\nsolutions, similar to a number of other products (Maple, Matlab, Macsyma,\netc.), which began to appear around the same time.  Mathematica was good at\nfinding exact solutions, and also pretty good at graphics.  Wolfram quit\nIllinois, took the program private, and entered into complicated lawsuits with\nboth his former employee and his co-authors (all since settled).\n\nWolfram has since retreated from normal scientific life, in to, on the one\nhand, tending the Mathematica empire, and, on the other, his peculiar\nscientific vision and method.  The vision is of the universe as, if not exactly\na CA, then a simple discrete program of some sort.  The method has involved an\nenormous number of man-hours on the part of subordinates who are, as it were,\nenserfed to him, scanning the behavior of likely-looking CAs and signing over\nthe rights to their discoveries to Wolfram; their efforts are supplemented by\nfrequent lawsuits and threats of lawsuits against those whom Wolfram feels have\ninfringed on his turf.  (In 1986, for instance,\nWolfram filed\na patent on the idea of using CAs as discrete approximations to partial\ndifferential equations, long after the idea was commonplace in the field; it\nwas, for instance, expounded at length\nin two papers in the 1983\nconference proceedings he helped edit.\nHis 1986\npaper on the subject is, however, a very important contribution to the\nfield, now known as lattice-gas\nhydrodynamics.)\n\nWhat, then, is the revelation Wolfram has been vouchsafed?  What is\nthis new kind of science?  Briefly stated, it is the idea that we should give\nup trying on complicated, continuous models, using normal calculus or\nprobability theory or the like, which try to represent the mechanisms by which\ninteresting phenomena are produced, or at least to accurately reproduce the\ndetails of such phenomena.  Instead we should look for simple, discrete models,\nlike CAs (\"simple programs\", as he calls them) which qualitatively reproduce\ncertain striking features of those phenomena.  In addition to this\nmethodological advice, there is the belief that the universe must in some\nsense be such a simple program — as he has notoriously said,\n\"four lines of Mathematica\".  Most of the bulk of this monstrously bloated book\nis dedicated to examples of this approach, i.e., to CA rules which produce\npatterns looking like the growths of corals or trees, or explanations of how\nsimple CAs can be used to produce reasonably high-quality pseudo-random\nnumbers, or the like.\n\nAs the saying goes, there is much here that is new and true, but what is\ntrue is not new, and what is new is not true; and some of it is even old and\nfalse, or at least utterly unsupported.  Let's start with the true things that\naren't new.\n\nWolfram refers incessantly to his \"discovery\" that simple rules can\nproduce complex results.  Now, the word \"discovery\" here is legitimate, but\nonly in a special sense.  When I took pre-calculus in high school, I came up\nwith a method for solving systems of linear equations, independent of my\ntextbook and my teacher: I discovered it.  My teacher, more patient than I\nwould be with adolescent arrogance, gently informed me that it was a standard\ntechnique, in any book on linear algebra, called \"reduction to Jordan normal\nform\", after the man who discovered it in the 1800s.  Wolfram discovered simple\nrules producing complexity in just the same way that I discovered Jordan normal\nform.\n\nI am not going to dwell on the way that finding simple laws to account for\nmultitudes of complex phenomena has been the highest aim of the exact sciences\nsince at least Galileo and Newton.  But this idea has been a driving force in\nmathematical logic and computer science since Alan Turing, A. N. Kolmogorov and\nEmil Post (he of the \"tag\" system, of which more\nlater).  Herbert Simon eloquently\nexplained the importance of the idea for the study of adaptation, psychology\nand society in his famous 1969 book, The Sciences of the\nArtificial. In 1973, the physicist-turned-ecologist Robert May published\na well-known paper in Nature on, as the title had it, the\ncomplicated dynamics of a simple equation.  It was an idea that was very much\nin the air, everywhere, in the early 1980s when Wolfram came on the scene\n— to pick two books at random from 1984, for instance, neither especially\nhard reading, there was Valentino Braitenberg's wonderful venture in\nneuroscience and AI, Vehicles,\nand William Poundstone's\npopular book on cellular automata and \"cosmic complexity,\" The Recursive\nUniverse (sadly out of print).  I could multiply instances ad\nnauseam, if I haven't already.\n\nIn an atrocious chapter on processes of learning and perception, Wolfram\nsays that Mathematica, because it works by applying transformation rules to\nexpressions that fit certain patterns, has a unique affinity for the way the\nhuman mind works, an affinity that isn't captured by any theory in cognitive\nscience or AI.  But this is just a rough description of the production-rules\napproach to modeling cognition, including memory, which was pioneered in the\nearly 1950s by Herbert\nSimon and Allen\nNewell.  In fact, their work helped drive the development of the LISP\nprogramming language, from which Mathematica descends.  The book is full to\nbursting with this kind of thing, in every area of science it touches on that\nI'm at all familiar with. I could go over Wolfram's discussion of biological\npattern formation, gravity, etc., etc., and give plenty of references to people\nwho've had these ideas earlier.  They have also had them better, in\nthat they have been serious enough to work out their consequences, grasp their\nstrengths and weaknesses, and refine or in some cases abandon them.  That is,\nthey have done science, where Wolfram has merely thought.\n\nBy way of making the transition to the new, untrue stuff, let's consider\nwhat we mean by \"simple\" and \"complex\".  This is a highly involved subject, as\nthere are many different proposed measures of complexity.\n(Badii and\nPoliti's Complexity remains the best survey.)  The classical\nnotion is that of algorithmic complexity, often called Kolmogorov complexity\nafter one of its three simultaneous discoverers.  (The other two\nwere Ray Solomonoff\nand Gregory\nChaitin.)  The algorithmic complexity of an object, say a string of digits,\nis the length of the shortest computer program which will produce that object\nand then halt.  There is always a program which can do this; if the object\nis x, the program \"print(x)\" will do, and the length\nof this program is the same as the length of x, plus a trivial\nconstant.  Simple objects only need short programs; complex objects need\nprograms approximately as long as the original object, and are called\n\"incompressible\".  Kolmogorov's goal, in setting up algorithmic complexity, was\nto give a non-probabilistic definition of randomness.  Probability theory tells\nus much about what random sequences of digits must be like; in a uniform random\nsequence of binary digits, for instance, there must be as many instances of\n\"01\" as \"00\", to give a trivial example.  Speaking roughly, Kolmogorov showed\nin the 1960s that infinitely long incompressible sequences have all the\nproperties of random sequences.\n\nAround 1970, Kolmogorov's disciple, Per Martin-Löf, extended this, in a\nvery interesting direction.  If we consider a finite random sequence,\nthere is some probability that it won't exactly satisfy any given property of\nthe ideal infinite random sequence — it might contain \"01\" slightly more\noften than \"00\", say.  This leads to the idea of testing for\nrandomness, and accepting as random only objects which are sufficiently close\nto the ideal, i.e., which do not deviate from the ideal in ways which would be\nvery improbable.  Martin-Löf showed, again roughly speaking, that complex\nobjects will pass many high-reliability tests for randomness,\nand conversely objects which pass randomness\ntests must have high algorithmic complexity.\n\nWolfram (naturally) ignores all existing measures of physical complexity,\nand (quite astonishingly) avoids giving any quantitative measure of complexity\nof his own.  Instead, he just says he'll count as complex things which are (I)\nvisually interesting and (II) pass standard tests for randomness, as used in\ncomputer programming and cryptography.  Now, if something satisfies (I), that\nis as much a fact about Stephen Wolfram, or, more generously, about the visual\ncortex of the East African Plains Ape, as it is a fact about the object.\nPassing (II) just means, by virtue of Martin-Löf's results, that the\nalgorithmic complexity is not too low.  Significantly, this part of\nMartin-Löf's work is never mentioned by Wolfram.\n\nAs for the new, untrue stuff, there's so much I hardly know where to start.\nBut he and I were both trained as physicists, so I'll pick on his account of\nquantum mechanics, relativity and gravitation.  I said earlier that CAs are the\ndiscrete counterparts of classical field theories.  If the universe worked by\nclassical physics, then one could argue that a CA approach to physics might\nwork just as well as the continuous-field approach, provided you made the scale\nof the cells small enough, and the number of states per cell large enough.\n(Many people have so argued.)  After all, movies demonstrate that apparent\ncontinuity is no argument for real continuity, and it's hard to see how any\ntest could do more than put an upper bound on the scale of the cells. But we\nknow classical physics isn't right; the universe is (to a much better\napproximation) quantum and relativistic.  It's comparatively easy to define\nquantum cellular automata; this is in effect what the sub-industry of lattice\nquantum field theory does.  What's harder is to get relativity right.  Ordinary\nCAs are well-adapted to classical space-time, but not to the space-time of\neither special or general relativity.  (They can have Galilean invariance, but\nnot Lorentzian.)  With some ingenuity, you can get a discretized version of\nspecial relativity to work in CAs (this was shown by Mark Smith in a 1994\ndissertation at MIT).  No one has figured out how to make general relativity,\nand with it gravity, work in a CA.  Wolfram is aware of this, and tries to\nexplain both quantum mechanics and gravity through deterministic dynamics on a\nkind of recursive network (not a CA).  This is reminiscent of much more\nadvanced work on \"spin foams\" in quantum gravity, which however\ndoes not try to explain away quantum effects, and is susceptible to\nactual calculations.  (This approach is also known\nas \"loop quantum gravity\".)\nIn any event, not long after this book was\npublished, Scott Aaronson\nproved that Wolfram's scheme must either conflict with special relativity\n(by breaking Lorentz invariance), or conflict with quantum mechanics (by\nobeying Bell's inequalities), or indeed both.  It is a non-starter.\n\nAnother egregious weakness is biology.  Wolfram displays absolutely no\nunderstanding of evolution, or what would be necessary to explain the\nadaptation of organisms to their environments.  This is related to his peculiar\nviews on methodology.  If you want to get a rough grasp of how the leopard\nmight get its spots, then building a CA model (or something similar) can be\nvery illuminating.  It will not tell you whether that's actually how\nit works.  This is an important example, because there is a classic theory of\nbiological pattern formation, or morphogenesis, first formulated by Turing in\nthe 1950s, which lends itself very easily to modeling in CAs, and with a little\nfine-tuning produces things which look like animal coats, butterfly wings,\netc., etc.  The problem is that there is absolutely no reason to think that's\nhow those patterns actually form; no one has identified even a single pair of\nTuring morphogens, despite decades of searching. [See \"Update, 4 March 2012\"\nbelow.]  Indeed, the more the biologists unravel the actual mechanisms of\nmorphogenesis, the more\ncomplicated and inelegant\n(but reliable) it looks.  If, however, you think you have\nexplained why leopards are spotted after coming up with a toy model that\nproduces spots, it will not occur to you to ask why leopards have spots but\npolar bears do not, which is to say that you will simply be blind to the whole\nproblem of biological adaptation.\n\nLeaving evolution and adaptation to one side, saving the qualitative\nphenomena doesn't mean that you have the right mechanism,\neven qualitatively. If, in addition, you want quantitative accuracy\n— either for engineering purposes, or to compare hypotheses which all\nproduce the same qualitative results — you obviously can't just get by\nwith Wolfram's \"new kind of science\" — or, as we say in the trade, with\ntoy models.  To be fair, toy models sometimes can be quantitatively\naccurate, but only in peculiar\ncircumstances which do not generally obtain, and certainly don't extend to\nWolfram's toys.  We must not, however, expect this to deter a man capable of\nsummarizing his methodology in the brilliant\naphorism, \"I\nam my own reality check.\"\nThere is one new result in this book which is genuinely impressive, though\nnot so impressive as Wolfram makes it out to be.  This is a proof that one of\nthe elementary CAs, Rule 110, can support universal computation.  To explain\nthis needs a slight detour through the foundations of computer science.\n\nTheoretical computer science studies the properties of abstract, formal\nsystems which do computations.  A common type of problem goes like this: given\nan abstract machine, an automaton, of a certain sort, what kinds of\ncomputations can it do?  For instance, if you have a machine with finite\nmemory, can it divide sequences of left and right parentheses into sequences\nwith an even number of right parentheses from those with an odd number of them?\n(Answer: yes.)  Could it recognize balanced sequences, in which every left\nparenthesis is a later matched by a corresponding right parenthesis, and vice\nversa?  (Answer: No; you need an unbounded memory.  Proof is left as an\nexercise.)  While these examples are trivial, more complicated versions become\nserious questions in linguistics, optimization, cryptography, data-bases,\ncompilers, etc.\n\nIn 1936, Turing proposed a class of automata which have since come to be\ncalled Turing machines, and showed that every function which can be defined\nrecursively can be computed by some Turing machine.  More remarkably yet, he\nshowed that there were universal Turing machines — ones which could be\nprogrammed to emulate any other Turing machine.  Now, there are other models of\ncomputation, other basic classes of automata, but so far it has turned out that\neverything they can compute can also be computed by Turing machines.  We can\nshow that some of these, in turn, can compute anything a Turing machine can\ncompute.  This has led to the Church-Turing Thesis, that any function which can\nbe specified effectively can be computed by a Turing machine; a system which\ncan emulate a universal Turing machine is thus a universal computer.\n\nThe easiest way to show that something is a universal computer is to show\nthat it can emulate something you already know is a universal computer, like a\nTuring machine.  Now, it's been known since the work of Emil Post in the 1930s\nthat something called a Post tag system\n(see here\nor here for more or less\nmathematical explanations) is Turing-equivalent.  A New Kind of\nScience describes a new formal system, called a cyclic tag system\n(Wolfram drops \"Post\"), which is equivalent to a Post tag system, and so to a\nuniversal Turing machine.  Finally, there is a sketch of how propagating\nstructures (\"gliders\") in Rule 110 can be used to implement a cyclic tag\nsystem, assuming you had an infinite lattice to play with.\n\nThis is a genuinely new result.  Rule 110 is the simplest CA (in terms of\nthe number of states and the rule radius) which is known to support universal\ncomputation.  (Indeed, in his 1985 book on cellular automata, Wolfram declared\nthat universal computation in an elementary CA was obviously impossible.)\nHowever, lots of things are capable of universal computation — there's\nless interest in this kind of result than there was in, say, 1970.  In 1990,\nfor instance, Cristopher Moore\ndevised a kind of\nidealized pin-ball machine which is capable of universal computation.  This\nresult, like the one about rule 110, is neat for people who care about\ndynamical models of universal computation — on the order of a thousand\nscientists and mathematicians world wide.  What Wolfram wants to claim is that,\nsince one universal computer is equivalent to another, by studying the behavior\nof one we learn things which are true of all others (true), therefore Rule 110\nis as complex as anything in the universe, and all intelligent life, including,\nperhaps, the gods must have much in common.  This, to put it mildly, does not\nfollow.  Wolfram even goes on to refute post-modernism on this basis; I won't\ntouch that except to say that I'd have paid a lot to see Wolfram and Jacques\nDerrida go one-on-one.\n\nThe real problem with this result, however, is that it is not Wolfram's.  He\ndidn't invent cyclic tag systems, and he didn't come up with the incredibly\nintricate construction needed to implement them in Rule 110.  This was done\nrather by one Matthew Cook, while working in Wolfram's employ under a contract\nwith some truly remarkable provisions about intellectual property.  In short,\nWolfram got to control not only when and how the result was made public, but to\nclaim it for himself.  In fact, his position was that the existence of\nthe result was a trade secret.  Cook, after a messy falling-out with Wolfram,\nmade the result, and the proof, public at a 1998 conference on CAs.  (I\nattended, and was lucky enough to read the paper where Cook goes through the\nconstruction, supplying the details missing from A New Kind of\nScience.)  Wolfram, for his part, responded by suing or threatening to\nsue Cook (now a penniless graduate student in neuroscience), the conference\norganizers, the publishers of the proceedings, etc.  (The threat of legal\naction from Wolfram that I mentioned at the beginning of this review arose\nbecause we cited Cook as the person responsible for this result.)\n\nOf course, lots of professors add their names to their students' papers, and\nmany lab-chiefs owe their enviable publication records to the fact that they\nautomatically add their names to the end of every manuscript prepared under\ntheir command.  If Wolfram did that, he would merely be perpetuating one of the\nmore common abuses of the current scientific community.  But to deny Cook any\nauthorship, and to threaten people with lawsuits to keep things quiet, is\nindeed very low.  Happily, the suit between Wolfram and Cook has finally been\nresolved, and\nCook's paper\nhas been published, under his own name, in Wolfram's journal Complex\nSystems.\n\nSo much for substance.  Let me turn to the style, which is that of monster\nraving egomania, beginning with the acknowledgments.  Conventionally, this is\nyour chance to be modest, to give credit to your sources, friends, and\ninevitably long-suffering nearest and dearest.  Wolfram uses it, in five point\ntype, to thank his drudges (including Matthew Cook for \"technical content and\nproofs\"), and thank people he's talked to, not for giving him ideas and\ncorrections, but essentially for giving him the opportunity to come up with his\nown ideas, owing nothing to them.  (Bringing to mind Monty Python: \"Your\nMajesty is like a stream of bat's piss: you shine out like a shaft of gold,\nwhen all around is dark.\")  This extends to thanking his mother for giving him\na classical British education.  (Wolfram's ideas of gentlemanly conduct seem\nsomewhat at variance with those traditionally associated with Eton.)  The\ncustomary self-effacement of scientific prose sometimes leads to boring\nwriting, but it is immensely preferable to incessant self-aggrandizement.  This\nextends even to grammar: wherever possible, Wolfram talks about other people's\nefforts in the passive voice (\"the notion of undecidability was developed in the\n1930s\", not \"Gödel and Turing developed the notion of undecidability\").\nWolfram actually has the gall to say that he's deliberately writing like this,\nto help readers understand his difficult ideas!\n\nNormally, scientific work is full of references to previous works, if only\nto say things like \"the outmoded theory of Jones [1], unable to accommodate\nstubborn experimental facts [2--25], has generally fallen out of favor\".  This\nis how you indicate what's new, what you're relying on, how you let readers\nimmerse themselves in the web of ideas that is an particular field of research.\nWolfram has deliberately omitted references.  Now, this is sometimes done:\nDarwin did it in The Origin of Species, for instance, to try to\nget it to press quickly.  But Wolfram has written 1100 pages over about a\ndecade; what would it have hurt to have included citations?  In his end-notes,\nwhere he purports to talk about what people have done, he is misleading, or\nwrong, or both.  (An indefinite number of examples can be provided upon\nrequest.)  To acknowledge that he had predecessors who were not universally\nblinkered fools would, however, conflict with the persona he tries to project\nto others, and perhaps to himself.\n\nLet me try to sum up.  On the one hand, we have a large number of true but\ncommonplace ideas, especially about how simple rules can lead to complex\noutcomes, and about the virtues of toy models.  On the other hand, we have a\nlarge mass of dubious speculations (many of them also unoriginal).  We have,\nfinally, a single new result of mathematical importance, which is not actually\nthe author's.  Everything is presented as the inspired fruit of a lonely\ngenius, delivering startling insights in isolation from a blinkered and\nphilistine scientific community.  We have been this way before.\n\n[Some cranks] are brilliant and well-educated, often with an\nexcellent understanding of the branch of science in which they are speculating.\nTheir books can be highly deceptive imitations of the genuine article —\nwell-written and impressively learned....\n\t[C]ranks work in almost total isolation from their colleagues.  Not\nisolation in the geographical sense, but in the sense of having no fruitful\ncontacts with fellow researchers.... The modern pseudo-scientist... stands\nentirely outside the closely integrated channels through which new ideas are\nintroduced and evaluated.  He works in isolation.  He does not send his\nfindings to the recognized journals, or if he does, they are rejected for\nreasons which in the vast majority of cases are excellent.  In most cases the\ncrank is not well enough informed to write a paper with even a surface\nresemblance to a significant study.  As a consequence, he finds himself\nexcluded from the journals and societies, and almost universally ignored by\ncompetent workers in the field..... The eccentric is forced, therefore, to\ntread a lonely way.  He speaks before organizations he himself has founded,\ncontributes to journals he himself\nmay edit, and — until recently — publishes books only when he\nor his followers can raise sufficient funds to have them printed\nprivately.\nThus Martin Gardner's classic description of the crank scientist in the\nfirst chapter of\nhis Fads\nand Fallacies.  In lieu of superfluous comments, let us pass on to\nGardner's list of the \"five ways in which the sincere pseudo-scientist's\nparanoid tendencies are likely to be exhibited.\"\n\t\n\n He considers himself a genius.\n\t He regards his colleagues, without exception, as ignorant\nblockheads.  Everyone is out of step except himself....\n\t He believes himself unjustly persecuted and discriminated\nagainst....\n\t He has strong compulsions to focus his attacks on the greatest\nscientists and the best-established theories.  When Newton was the outstanding\nname in physics, eccentric works in that science were violently anti-Newton.\nToday, with Einstein the father-symbol of authority, a crank theory of physics\nis likely to attack Einstein in the name of Newton....\n\t He often has a tendency to write in a complex jargon, in many\ncases making use of terms and phrases he himself has coined....\n\t\n\n(1) is clearly true.  (2) is clearly true.  (3) is currently false,\nor at least not much on display in this book.  (4) is clearly true, though\nWolfram, befitting someone who was once a respectable physicist, aims to\nundermine Newton and Einstein, indeed the entire tradition of physical\nscience since Galileo.  (5) is true only to a very small degree (mercifully).\n\n\tWhen the crank's I.Q. is low, as in the case of the late\nWilber Glenn Voliva who thought the earth shaped like a pancake, he rarely\nachieves much of a following.  But if he is a brilliant thinker, he is capable\nof developing incredibly complex theories.  He will be able to defend them in\nbooks of vast erudition, with profound observations, and often liberal portions\nof sound science.  His rhetoric may be enormously persuasive.  All the parts of\nhis world usually fit together beautifully, like a jig-saw puzzle.\nThe natural result is a cult following.  Wolfram certainly has that, to\njudge from his sales, the attendance at his \"New Kind of Science\" conventions,\nand the reader reviews on Amazon.  (I presume they are not\nall a claque hired by Wolfram Media.)  This frankly is part of a\ndisturbing trend, pronounced within the field of complex systems.  In addition\nto Wolfram, I might mention the cult of personality around Ilya Prigogine, and Stuart Kauffman's book\nInvestigations, or even the way George Lakoff uses \"as cognitive\nscience shows\" to mean \"as I claimed in my earlier books\".\n\nThis brings me to the core of what I dislike about Wolfram's book.  It is\ngoing to set the field back by years.  On the one hand, scientists in other\nfields are going to think we're all crackpots like him.  On the other hand,\nwe're going to be deluged, again, with people who fall for this kind\nof nonsense.  I expect to have to waste a lot of time in the next few years\nde-programming students who'll have read A New Kind of Science\nbefore knowing any better.\n\nI don't object to speculation or radical proposals, even to radical,\ngrandiose speculative proposals; I just want there to be arguments to back them\nup, reasons to take them seriously.  I don't object to scientists displaying\npersonality in their work, or staking out positions in vigorous opposition to\nmuch of the opinion in their field, and engaging in heated debate; I do object\nto ignoring criticism and claiming credit for commonplaces, especially before\npopular audiences who won't pick up on it.  I don't even object to writing 1000\npage tomes vindicating one's own views and castigating doubters; I do object to\n1000 page exercises in badly-written intellectual masturbation.  Consider, by\nway of contrast, the late physicist E. T. Jaynes.  For four decades, he\ndefended original, radical views on the role of probability in physics, the\nnature of statistical mechanics and the place of inductive reasoning in\nscience.  These views were hotly contested on all sides; Jaynes met criticism\nwith astringent but engaged and intellectually honest replies.  At the time of\nhis death, he was working, as he had been for years, on\na mammoth book\nthat would have been the final, definitive statement of his views; even in the\nfragmentary state he left it, it was roughly as long as Wolfram's tome, and\ninfinitely more valuable.  I\nthink Jaynes's ideas\nwere dead wrong, but I wouldn't dream of calling him a crank.\n\nI suppose it's customary in writing reviews of this sort to try to say what\nhas driven Wolfram to write such a bad, self-destructive book.  But the truth\nis I couldn't care less.  He has talent, and once had some promise; he has\nsquandered them.  I am going to keep my copy of A New Kind of\nScience, sitting on the same shelf as Atlantis in\nWisconsin, The Cosmic Forces of Mu, Of\nGrammatology, and the people who think the golden ratio explains the\nuniverse.\n\n\nUpdate, 4 March 2012: There is now a fairly convincing\nexample of a pair of Turing morphogens in actual biology:\n\nAndrew D.

In cases where the parties disagree on what the law is, a common law court looks to past precedential decisions of relevant courts, and synthesizes the principles of those past cases as applicable to the current facts.  If a similar dispute has been resolved in the past, the court is usually bound to follow the reasoning used in the prior decision (a principle known as stare decisis). If, however, the court finds that the current dispute is fundamentally distinct from all previous cases (called a \"matter of first impression\"), and legislative statutes are either silent or ambiguous on the question, judges have the authority and duty to resolve the issue (one party or the other has to win, and on disagreements of law, judges make that decision).[7] The court states an opinion that gives reasons for the decision, and those reasons agglomerate with past decisions as precedent to bind future judges and litigants. Common law, as the body of law made by judges,[3][8] stands in contrast to and on equal footing with statutes which are adopted through the legislative process, and regulations which are promulgated by the executive branch (the interactions among these different sources of law are explained later in this article).  Stare decisis, the principle that cases should be decided according to consistent principled rules so that similar facts will yield similar results, lies at the heart of all common law systems.[9]\n", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_law#Common_law_legal_systems_as_opposed_to_civil_law_legal_systems", "hostname": "en.wikipedia.org", "category": "wiki_article", "comment_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19213599"}, {"title": "Stop that!

In a U.S. historical context, the phrase 'Corporate Personhood' refers to the ongoing legal debate over the extent to which rights traditionally associated with natural persons should also be afforded to corporations. A headnote issued by the Court Reporter in the 1886 Supreme Court case Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad Co. claimed to state the sense of the Court regarding the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment as it applies to corporations, without the Court having actually made a decision or issued a written opinion on that point. This was the first time that the Supreme Court was reported to hold that the Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection clause granted constitutional protections to corporations as well as to natural persons, although numerous other cases, since Dartmouth College v. Woodward in 1819, had recognized that corporations were entitled to some of the protections of the Constitution. In Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. (2014), the Court found that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 exempted Hobby Lobby from aspects of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act because those aspects placed a substantial burden on the closely held company's owners' exercise of free religion.[2]\n", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_personhood", "hostname": "en.wikipedia.org", "category": "wiki_article", "comment_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19212031"}, {"title": "Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act - Wikipedia", "description": "The Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act of 1980 (FIRPTA), enacted as Subtitle C of Title XI (the \"Revenue Adjustments Act of 1980\") of the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1980, Pub.

That is my weakness and I\naccept it. But is means that I have been left with trying to develop,\ndocument, and support Shorewall almost single-handedly. I cannot do it any more.\n\nI have apparently been able to create the illusion of more success than has\nbeen achieved. Sean believes that he should be able to ignore the notices on\nthe Shorewall 1.3 web site announcing that support for that release has\nceased and thinks that the errata page should still have updated Shorewall\ncomponents for a release that my 60 year old mind can't remember most of the\ndetails about. And he is right to expect that. But I can't deliver it.\n\nAnd I just cannot deal with the support and documentation frustration any\nmore -- support, the documentation and the web site consume an order of\nmagnitude more of my time than does Shorewall development. Apparently, I am\ncompletely inept at web site design because people just can't find the\ninformation that they need; and I have no more energy to try to fix it.\n\nSince I began developing Shorewall:\n\na) I have gained over 60 pounds in weight.\nb) My lawn and landscaping have become an embarrassment in the neighborhood.\nc) I have begun exhibiting addictive behavior toward Linux and Shorewall.\nd) I have developed sleep disorders (I use a breathing aid at night)\ne) I dislike my life.\n\nIt's time to get myself cleaned up and re-enter the life of the living.\n\nI will leave the Shorewall website and server in place until July 4 in case\nthere is any community interest in picking up the pieces. Please email me\nprivately if you are interested in carrying on; I'll do what I can to help.\n\nTonight I am deleting myself from all of the Shorewall and Leaf mailing lists.\n\nI will clean up what I have for a 2.3 release and place it on the server as\nthe last Shorewall release -- Shorewall 2.4.0.\n\nI would like to express my appreciation for all who have used Shorewall and\nwho have enriched my life through Shorewall. I especially appreciate:\n\n- Steve Cowles who helped me so much in the early days\n- Francesca Smith who picked up the sample configurations when I had had it\nwith them\n- Mike Noyes who was always willing to help improve the documentation.\n\nI regret letting down those of you who depend on Shorewall. But look at it\nthis way -- you have the source for all of the code that you run and it's\nall written in a very simple programming language. And there was always the\npossiblilty that I would walk in front of a bus.\n\n... and you have to admit that the price was right :-)\n\nShorewall will always be a part of my life that I look back on with fondness.\n\nAs always,\n\n-Tom\n-- \nTom Eastep    \\ Nothing is foolproof to a sufficiently talented fool\nShoreline,     \\ http://shorewall.net\nWashington USA  \\ teastep at shorewall.net\nPGP Public Key   \\ https://lists.shorewall.net/teastep.pgp.key\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn embedded message was scrubbed...\nFrom: Sean Covel <seanecovel at comcast.net>\nSubject: Re: [leaf-user] New RFC1918 file needed?\nDate: Tue, 17 May 2005 22:02:18 -0400\nSize: 4866\nUrl: http://lists.shorewall.net/pipermail/shorewall-users/attachments/20050517/1554ab1a/leaf-userNewRFC1918fileneeded.mht\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious message: [Shorewall-users] open ports confusion\n\nNext message: [Shorewall-users] I quit.\n\n Messages sorted by:\n[ date ]\n[ thread ]\n[ subject ]\n[ author ]\n\n\n\nMore information about the Shorewall-users\nmailing list\n", "url": "http://lists.shorewall.net/pipermail/shorewall-users/2005-May/018444.html", "hostname": "lists.shorewall.net", "category": "uncategorized", "comment_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19221523"}, {"title": "Building my ideal router for $50", "description": null, "url": "https://blog.tjll.net/building-my-perfect-router/", "hostname": "blog.tjll.net", "category": "uncategorized", "comment_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19223743"}, {"title": "Router - ArchWiki", "description": "This article is a tutorial for turning a computer into an internet gateway/router.

For now, this guide is still the most complete and best reviewed.  Any contributions to the new guide are welcome via GitHub forks. This guide aims to aid people interested in learning to work with BASH.  It aspires to teach good practice techniques for using BASH, and writing simple scripts. This guide is targeted at beginning users.  It assumes no advanced knowledge -- just the ability to login to a Unix-like system and open a command-line (terminal) interface.  It will help if you know how to use a text editor; we will not be covering editors, nor do we endorse any particular editor choice.  Familiarity with the fundamental Unix tool set, or with other programming languages or programming concepts, is not required, but those who have such knowledge may understand some of the examples more quickly. If something is unclear to you, you are invited to report this (use BashGuideFeedback, or the #bash channel on irc.freenode.org) so that it may be clarified in this document for future readers. You are invited to contribute to the development of this document by extending it or correcting invalid or incomplete information. The primary maintainer(s) of this document: -- Lhunath (primary author) -- GreyCat The guide is also available in PDF format. Alternatively, you can just hit print after going to FullBashGuide.  That guarantees you'll be printing the latest version of this document.   \nA Definition\nBASH is an acronym for Bourne Again Shell.  It is based on the Bourne shell and is mostly compatible with its features. Shells are command interpreters.  They are applications that provide users with the ability to give commands to their operating system interactively, or to execute batches of commands quickly.  In no way are they required for the execution of programs; they are merely a layer between system function calls and the user. Think of a shell as a way for you to speak to your system.  Your system doesn't need it for most of its work, but it is an excellent interface between you and what your system can offer.  It allows you to perform basic math, run basic tests and execute applications.  More importantly, it allows you to combine these operations and connect applications to each other to perform complex and automated tasks. BASH is not your operating system.  It is not your window manager.  It is not your terminal (but it oftens runs inside your terminal).  It does not control your mouse or keyboard.  It does not configure your system, activate your screensaver, or open your files when you double-click them.  It is generally not involved in launching applications from your window manager or desktop environment.  It's important to understand that BASH is only an interface for you to execute statements (using BASH syntax), either at the interactive BASH prompt or via BASH scripts.  In The Manual: Introduction  Shell: A (possibly interactive) command interpreter, acting as a layer between the user and the system. \nBash: The Bourne Again Shell, a Bourne compatible shell.   \nUsing Bash\nMost users that think of BASH think of it as a prompt and a command line.  That is BASH in interactive mode.  BASH can also run in non-interactive mode, as when executing scripts.  We can use scripts to automate certain logic.  Scripts are basically lists of commands (just like the ones you can type on the command line), but stored in a file.  When a script is executed, all these commands are (generally) executed sequentially, one after another. We'll start with the basics in an interactive shell. Once you're familiar with those, you can put them together in scripts. Important! \n You should make yourself familiar with the man and apropos commands on the shell.  They will be vital to your self-tutoring. $ man man\n$ man aproposIn this guide, the $ at the beginning of a line represents your BASH prompt.  Traditionally, a shell prompt either ends with $, % or #.  If it ends with $, this indicates a shell that's compatible with the Bourne shell (such as a POSIX shell, or a Korn shell, or Bash).  If it ends with %, this indicates a C shell (csh or tcsh); this guide does not cover C shell.  If it ends with #, this indicates that the shell is running as the system's superuser account (root), and that you should be extra careful. Your actual BASH prompt will probably be much longer than $.  Prompts are often highly individualized. The man command stands for \"manual\"; it opens documentation (so-called \"man pages\") on various topics.  You use it by running the command man [topic] at the BASH prompt, where [topic] is the name of the \"page\" you wish to read.  Note that many of these \"pages\" are considerably longer than one printed page; nevertheless, the name persists.  Each command (application) on your system is likely to have a man page.  There are pages for other things too, such as system calls or specific configuration files.  In this guide, we will only be covering commands. Note that if you're looking for information on BASH built-ins (commands provided by BASH, not by external applications) you should look in man bash instead.  BASH's manual is extensive and detailed.  It is an excellent reference, albeit more technical than this guide. Bash also offers a help command which contains brief summaries of its built-in commands (which we'll discuss in depth later on). $ help\n$ help read In the FAQ: \nIs there a list of which features were added to specific releases (versions) of Bash?  Interactive mode: A mode of operation where a prompt asks you for one command at a time. Script: A file that contains a sequence of commands to execute one after the other.  \nContents\nThe guide has been divided into sections, which are intended to be read roughly in the order presented.

Early results from research at the University of California, Davis, indicate that just a touch of the ocean algae in cattle feed could dramatically cut greenhouse gas emissions from California’s 1.8 million dairy cows.\n\n“This is a very surprising and promising development,” said animal science professor and Sesnon Endowed Chair Ermias Kebreab inside the UC Davis dairy barn where he is testing seaweed efficacy with 12 Holstein cows. “Results are not final, but so far we are seeing substantial emission reductions. This could help California’s dairy farmers meet new methane-emission standards and sustainably produce the dairy products we need to feed the world.”\n\nKebreab’s project is the first to test seaweed on live dairy cattle anywhere in the world.\n\nHis team will publish preliminary findings in late June and begin further tests with additional cattle later this summer.\nProfessor Ermias Kebreab with the UC Davis Department of Animal Science is conducting research with dairy cows to find out if seaweed will reduce methane emissions from cattle. Results are promising, but not final.\n\nA question of digestion\n\nCows and other “ruminant” animals like goats and sheep burp continuously throughout the day as they digest food in their rumen, the first of four sections of their stomachs. The rumen is home to millions of microbes that help ferment and break down high-fiber food like grass and hay. This fermentation produces gases that combine to form methane, an especially potent heat-trapping gas.\n\nSo, as cattle perpetually burp and exhale, they emit methane. Cows also pass methane gas from the other end, but to a much lesser degree. Manure, too, is a source of methane emissions.\n\nIn an effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, California legislators recently adopted regulations requiring dairy farmers and other producers to cut methane emissions 40 percent by 2030.\n\n“Since much of a dairy’s methane emissions come from the animal itself, nutrition can play a big role in finding solutions,” said Kebreab.\n\nMolasses, please  \n\nTesting supplements in cattle feed is not new. Kebreab and his colleagues at UC Davis and beyond are finding varying degrees of success with a wide range of feed additives. Some compounds work in the lab with simulated cattle digestive systems, but not with live animals. Researchers in England, for example, found success with curry supplements until they tested it with live cattle.\n\n“The cows didn’t like the curry,” Kebreab said.\n\nDuring lab tests last year, researchers in Australia found that just 2 percent seaweed in cattle feed could reduce methane emissions by 99 percent. The seaweed apparently inhibits an enzyme that contributes to methane production.\n\n \nJudging from the reaction of the UC Davis cows, the seaweed is so far, so good — especially when cut with a bit of molasses.\n\n“The molasses masks the smell,” Kebreab said, smiling as two Holsteins nudged a gate that opens when it’s time for their next meal. “They enjoy their feed.”\n\nTo test seaweed efficacy, Kebreab and animal nutrition graduate student Breanne Roque have separated 12 cows into three groups. Two groups are fed with different doses of seaweed, and one group’s feed has no seaweed at all. They rotate through the two-week feeding regimens with a weeklong seaweed fast in between.   \n\nFour times a day, cows get a snack from an open-air contraption that measures the methane in their breath as they eat the treat.\n An open-air device measures the methane in the cows’ breath as they eat a treat. (Gregory Urquiaga/UC Davis)“The numbers we’re seeing are amazing — well beyond the target that farmers will need to reach,” Kebreab said.\n\nThroughout the seaweed diet, the cows’ milk is tested for qualities like yield, flavor and nutritional content.  \n\nA love of milk \n\nSustainable dairy production is not just an academic endeavor for Kebreab. He has loved milk since he was a young boy growing up in Eritrea, a country in the Horn of Africa.\n\n“I was always amazed at how an animal that eats grass can produce such a high-quality food,” Kebreab said. “And I loved the taste. We didn’t get that much — maybe once or twice a week. I wondered, can we find a way to produce enough milk for everyone?”\n\nKebreab is trying. Among his many projects, Kebreab recently received a $500,000 grant to help improve sustainable livestock production in Ethiopia and Burkina Faso, where dairy cattle produce 5 to 10 liters of milk per day compared to the 45 liters that cows in California can produce. He is working with researchers and funding from the University of Florida with support from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\n“By improving the quality and quantity of dairy production in developing countries, we help families rise from poverty and malnutrition, and also reduce the carbon footprint of cattle worldwide,” Kebreab said.\n\nIf seaweed proves to be a climate-smart supplement, producing it could be environmentally friendly, too. As Kebreab notes, “Growing seaweed doesn’t require land, fresh water or fertilizer.”\nA small amount of macro red algae, a type of seaweed pictured here, is mixed with molasses and cattle feed in a research project by UC Davis Professor Ermias Kebreab.
