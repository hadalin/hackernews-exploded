In a U.S. historical context, the phrase 'Corporate Personhood' refers to the ongoing legal debate over the extent to which rights traditionally associated with natural persons should also be afforded to corporations. A headnote issued by the Court Reporter in the 1886 Supreme Court case Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad Co. claimed to state the sense of the Court regarding the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment as it applies to corporations, without the Court having actually made a decision or issued a written opinion on that point. This was the first time that the Supreme Court was reported to hold that the Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection clause granted constitutional protections to corporations as well as to natural persons, although numerous other cases, since Dartmouth College v. Woodward in 1819, had recognized that corporations were entitled to some of the protections of the Constitution. In Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. (2014), the Court found that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 exempted Hobby Lobby from aspects of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act because those aspects placed a substantial burden on the closely held company's owners' exercise of free religion.[2]\n", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_personhood", "hostname": "en.wikipedia.org", "category": "wiki_article", "comment_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19212031"}, {"title": "Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act - Wikipedia", "description": "The Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act of 1980 (FIRPTA), enacted as Subtitle C of Title XI (the \"Revenue Adjustments Act of 1980\") of the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1980, Pub.

The Arlington Resort Hotel & Spa is a nearly 500 room resort in the Ouachita Mountains of Hot Springs National Park, Arkansas, home of Oaklawn Race Track and the Arkansas Derby.  The resort has accommodations for single occupancy or groups between 20 and 2000. Mineral baths are available in the Spa between the third and fourth floor, which make use of the natural hot springs. Massages and hot stone treatments are also available in the Spa. The hotel contains three restaurants, an open bar in the main lobby, a full service beauty salon, a gift shop, a ladies shopping boutique, and live entertainment on weekends. Guests enjoy golf and tennis privileges at the Hot Springs Country Club, approximately 2.7 miles to the south east.  The hotel is located at the north end of \"Bathhouse Row\". As of 2009, the Arlington is a three star hotel.  Samuel W. Fordyce and two other entrepreneurs financed the construction of the first luxury hotel in the area, the first Arlington Hotel which opened in 1875. When it was rebuilt in 1892-93, it was known as the New Arlington, and boasted of its Spanish Renaissance architecture. With 300 rooms in four stories of red brick, it had corner towers. This second Arlington burned to the ground on April 5, 1923. Those buildings were at the north end of Bathhouse Row, where the Arlington Park then was created. The third Arlington Hotel, designed by Mann and Stern in 1925, is the current hotel at the \"Y\" intersection at the corner of Central Avenue and Fountain Street. The building's huge size, Spanish-Colonial Revival style, and placement at the terminus of the town's most important vista made the building a key Hot Springs landmark. The original site became a park at the north end of Bathhouse Row.  In the 1930s, the Arlington Hotel was a favorite vacation spot for Al Capone.  en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlington_Hotel_(Hot_Springs_Nation...  View from Scenic Mountain Drive up Hot Springs Mountain in Hot Springs National Park, Hot Springs, Arkansas.  Hot Springs is the 10th most populous city in the U.S. state of Arkansas, the county seat of Garland County, and the principal city of the Hot Springs Metropolitan Statistical Area encompassing all of Garland County. According to 2008 Census Bureau estimates, the population of the city was 39,467.  Hot Springs is traditionally best known for the natural spring water that gives it its name, flowing out of the ground at a temperature of 147 degrees Fahrenheit (64 degrees C). Hot Springs National Park is the oldest federal reserve in the USA, and the tourist trade brought by the famous springs make it a very successful spa town.  The city takes its name from the natural thermal water that flows from 47 springs on the western slope of Hot Springs Mountain in the historic downtown district of the city. About a million gallons of 143-degree water flow from the springs each day. The rate of flow is not affected by fluctuations in the rainfall in the area. Studies by National Park Service scientists have determined through carbon dating that the water that reaches the surface in Hot Springs fell as rainfall in an as-yet undetermined watershed 4,000 years earlier. The water percolates very slowly down through the earth‚Äôs surface until it reaches superheated areas deep in the crust and then rushes rapidly to the surface to emerge from the 47 hot springs.  A small channel of hot spring water known as Hot Springs Creek runs under ground from an area near Park Avenue to Bath House Row.  en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_Springs,_Arkansas  en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_...

Originally I tried to use some low-drag NACA\nducts but they didn't supply enough air so I added scoops, which improved things\nbut the engine is still starving for air.\n\nThe next step is some internal ducting to direct the incoming air towards the engine's\nintake.\n\nBut enjoy the video of progress to date:\n\n\n\nHow fast?\nHere's the latest video of my PJ8C-powered Long-EZ ARF flying.\n\nI swapped out the original first-prototype for the second prototype on which\nall production engines are based.  This is now one seriously-fast RC model.\n\nThere are many turbine-powered models costing thousands of dollars which can't\nkeep up with this low-cost jet-powered ARF and instead of using expensive,\nharder to get jet-fuel mixed expensive turbine oil, the PJ8C runs on regular\ngasoline from the pump at your local garage.\n\n\n\n\nOr you can watch it in high quality by clicking this link:\nVery fast PJ8C-powered Long-EZ ARF\n\nSee how the PJ8C is made\nQuite a few folks have asked to see how the PJ8C is made so I've created\na page with a few pictures and a brief description of how I build these engines.\nIf you're curious, check out the How the PJ8C is made page.\n\n\nHow do pulsejets work?\nAlthough I've written a lot about pulsejet engines, one of the questions I\nstill get asked most often is \"how do they work\".  To answer this I've\ncreated the following YouTube video.  I hope it will explain all.\n\n\n\nLimited number of new PJ8C ceramic-coated engines available\n\nI have a small quantity of the new redesigned\nPJ8C engines and other accessories for sale.\n\n\n\nThere's never been a cheaper way to get into jet-powered RC model flying.\n\nCeramic coating and pulsejets\nOne of the big problems with pulsejet engines is that they run very, very hot -- soemthing\nthat often limits their application and reduces their operation life.\n\nTo help reduce this problem, I'm now using a ceramic coating (which the manufacturer\nclaims is also used by NASA) on the inside of\nmy engines which protects the metal from exposure to hot combustion gases\nand also provides a measure of insulation -- effectively improving efficiency\nand reducing external operating temperatures.\n\nMore to follow on this...\n\n\nThe new PJ8 takes to the air (update)\nAn updated version of my PJ8 design has been test-flown in a cheap Chinese\nLong-EZ ARF. (and a special version for the BobCat 50 ARF should be ready\nin a week or two).\n\nThe fuel-bubble issues have been sorted now and I have been able to enjoy\nsome much longer flights with the PJ8/Long-EZ combination.\n\nAs you can see in the new video (below), the PJ8 is a good match for the Long-EZ\nairframe.  The reed valve that has now done quite a few flights and much static\nground-running (while fixing up the fuel system) finally expired on this flight -\nyou can year it starting to sound a bit odd near the end of the flight before\nI cut the engine.\n\n\n\nBecause the Long-EZ doesn't have a tail, it was very easy to modify for pulsejet\npower.\n\nMore video of the Long-EZ will be posted soon and the updated plans will be\nadded to my Pulsejet Book.\n\n\n\n\nAt last, ECU for pulsejets\n\nAn interesting project I've been working recently is an Engine Control Unit\nfor pulsejet engines.\n\n\n\nLots of folks have talked about using electronics to provide better control\nof pulsejet engines but, to the best of my knowledge, nobody has actually done\nso to date, or at least not until now.\n\nThe circuit you see in this picture is a rough and ready (but fully functional)\nprototype of my pulsejet ECU system.\n\nAlthough it looks a bit like a bird's-nest of wires and components, this ECU\ndoes some very clever stuff.  For example, it actually listens to each combustion\ncycle using a transducer.  That information (along with other data such\nas temperature, mass-flow and thrust) is constantly monitored and used to\nfine-tune the engine's operation and ensure maximum performance is achieved\nat all points on the power-curve.\n\nThe ECU also supports fully automated start/restart and shutdown for engines using gas\nand/or liquid fuel.\n\nRight now I'm designing the final circuit board which will see all that mess\ncondensed down to a unit about the size of a credit-card.\n\nStay tuned for more information and some video of the ECU in action.\n\nI'm back!\nAfter a long time away from my pulsejet projects I'm back!\n\n\n\nThis site will be getting a major facelift pretty soon and I'll be showing you\nsome of the cool stuff I've been working on in the pulsejet area.\n\n\nI'm currently preparing a new XJet prototype that will be shipped off to a university\nfor testing and validation of the performance, this being the final step before\ncommercial production.\n\nAnd I've also been very busy writing my book which is chock-full of stuff\nthat any tech-head will find both entertaining and interesting.\n\nIf you missed it, I see that the epsiode of ScrapHeap Challenge in which I\nappeared as an \"expert\" and directed a team of Navy engineers in their\ntask of building and racing a pulse-jet powered vehicle has been uploaded\nto YouTube.  Links to these videos are on my\nScrapheap Challenge page.\n\nThe biggest, meanest pulsejet dragster ever!\nUPDATE: we've had our first short runs in the dragster and it is, in a word,\n\"frightening\"!\n\nAnd here, as promised, are a few pictures of the tentative first few runs.\n\n\n\n\nThe power to weight ratio is extremely good, producing some really astounding\nacceleration, and the noise is astonishing -- especially when the engines\nlose synchronization and a beat-frequency can clearly be heard modulating\nthe level of sound and vibration.\n\nOne thing that immediately became apparent however, is that if the engines do\nlose synchronization, there's a definite tendency for the exhaust of one to be\ningested by the other, resulting in a premature flame-out.\n\nThis problem will be significantly reduced when the augmentors are added but\nin the meantime, a simple dividing plate between the two intake pipes seems\nto have dramatically reduced the magnitude of the problem -- albeit while\nmaking the engines less likely to sync-up in the first place.\n\n\n\nIt's been quite a while since I updated this website but I've been very busy\nin the workshop.  Here's a picture of what I've currently got under construction:\n\n\n\n\nThis monster is powered by two enhanced Lockwood valveless pulsejets which\nhave been tested to produce 150lbs of thrust each in an unaugmented configuration\nwhen run on propane.\n\nEarly tests on Jet A1 indicate that this thrust can be lifted to around 180lbs\neach and, with the addition of an augmentor, a figure of around 220lbs of static\nthrust per engine should be possible -- for a total of 440lbs.\n\nThe entire vehicle currently weighs in at under 180lbs so I'm expecting some\npretty impressive acceleration and speed.\n\nI'll be posting more pictures in the next week or so.\n\nNote that this engine design has been licensed to a New Zealand company\n(SimpleJets) who have\nalready started manufacturing.\n\nPulsejet CD download option\nThe entire contents of The Enthusiast's Guide to Pulsejet Engines will\nsoon be available for download by those who wish to purchase (or have\nalready purchased) it.  This means you'll get faster access to all that\ninteresting information and a wealth of detailed information on the\nhistory, design and construction of real pulsejet engines.\n\nNew No-weld pulsejet engine design\n\nIt's already on the CD, complete with a VCD-quality video, and soon I'll be\nuploading a set of somewhat more\nbasic instructions which means anyone can build this\npulsejet in their own garage with just a few hand-tools.\n\nNow there's no excuse for not building your own engine!\n\nPulsejet Book on CD Revised\nIf you've already got my book on CD, you will shortly be receiving\nanother disk containing a freshly revised edition with even more information\nand plans.  More information can be found here.\n\nTV Crews All Over The Place\n\nOver the past six weeks or so I've had TV crews here on a fairly regular basis.\nThey've been filming a couple of items on me and my jet engine activities. Unfortunately,\nthis footage is unlikely to be seen outside of New Zealand but we did some really\ncool night-runs with the JetKart that looked very impressive.\n\nThis shot in particular shows how a vortex forms in the exhaust of the pulsejet\nduring the exhaust phase.\n\nI'll post some more pictures from these night-shoots in a week or so when I've\nhad a chance to dump it onto my computer.\n\n\n\nKids, do not try this at home -- I am just crazy\n\n\nThe Pulsejet Book Is Finished!\nAt long last I have finished the final edition of what is perhaps\nYes, at long last, and thanks to the feedback from many readers of the\ndraft edition, the final version of \"The Enthusiast's Guide to Pulsejet Engines\"\nis completed and available on CD.  The printed edition will be available\nas a seperate item for those who prefer ink stains\non dead trees.

I was the one who designed the big pulsejet that featured\nin that episode, you can find out a little more here.\n\n\n\n\nGuess Who Was On Scrapheap Challenge?\nYes, I was recruited by the folks at RDF to act as an \"expert\" in the\nrecently screened jet-cars episode of the very popular\nScrapheap Challenge (aka Junkyard Wars)\nseries.\n\nFellow \"expert\" Nick Haddock and I have produced a CDROM that contains\na whole heap of information about our experiences on the show, along with\nlots of pictures, videos and plans that you can use to build your own\njet-powered karts using either a pulsejet or turbojet.\n\nSee this page for more information.\n\nStarting The New Pulsejet Engine\n\nDespite what you see at the top of this page there is no need to worry, no bald\npeople were harmed during the starting of this engine\nbut it sure looks spectacular don't you think?\n\nFortunately, after a bit of tweaking, this engine now starts without the need\nfor any kind of forced air -- amazing but true.  Here's a very short\nvideo clip\n(1.1MB MPEG) that shows how it can be started simply by turning on the fuel.  You can\nalso see how much power this engine has by the way it flattens the grass in\nfront of it.\n\nNote that the full plans and extra constructional information for this engine\nare included in the final draft of my pulsejet book. (see below)\n\n\nHow Fast Does The Jet Kart Go?\nUp until now I've just been guessing at the top speed of my jet-kart\nbut seat-of-the-pants estimates can be rather unreliable so I fitted\na GPS and took it out to a nice, long, straight piece of tarmac.\n\nHow fast did it go?  Click here to find out.\n\nNew Pictures of my BIG Lockwood pulsejet\nCheck out new pictures of the biggest Lockwood pulsejet I've ever built\nand see if you can work out what I'll be using it for.  The details\nare at the bottom of this page.\n\nComing Soon -- Jet-kart-Cam\nAs soon as the weather clears I'll be recording some onboard footage of\nthe jet-kart in action and the onboard GPS will tell me exactly how fast\nit's going.\n\nIt'll be the next best thing to actually being in the driver's seat so\nfind out more here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA big thanks to the\nAmerican Stirling Company\nwho have kindly contributed towards the operational costs of this website and\nongoing X-Jet development.\nPlease check out their engines, their quiet but efficient operation is almost\nthe complete opposite of a jet engine, which makes them every bit as interesting.\n\n\nSupport The Sponsor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>>>> Click HERE to find out what's new on the site\n\nThe $5,000 Cruise Missile\nVisitors to this site might also be interested in another project (a spin-off\nfrom my X-Jet development work) that is now underway.

It is simple enough that it could be fitted to almost any existing\npetal-valved pulsejet, including engines such as the Dynajet, Tiger Jet\nand others.\n\nFeel free to use this design in your own engines, all I ask is a little\nattribution where relevant.\n\n\nThis Site Is Looking For Sponsorship\nIf you're interested in perhaps sponsoring\nthis site then click here.\n\n23 June: You just have to see the latest Jet Kart picture I found!\n\nThe X-Jet To Go GPL?\nShould I place the X-Jet and all the R&D work done on it to date into the public domain?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Visitors since 6 April 2002\n\n\n\nThe Low Cost Cruise Missile\nWant to build your own cruise missile?

-- check out the pictures and video\nof my Gas Turbine Engine which I ran for the first\ntime on 9 April 2000.\n\nSome Background\nWhen I first started tinkering with pulsejet engine technology in 1999,\nI realized that there was huge potential for improving these devices.\n\nAlthough deceptively simple in construction, their design had changed\nlittle in the 55 years since the end of WW2, when they were rapidly\nreplaced by the now common turbojet.\n\nThe opportunity to apply 21st century materials and knowledge to the\ntask of improving a design still mired in the 1950's was too great\nto resist -- so I set about developing a range of engines, each\nincremental better than the last.\n\nIn early 2001 I took the results of over a year's experimentation\nand designed the radically new X-Jet engine which\nnow surpasses traditional pulsejet engines in terms of performance,\nefficiency and reliability by a huge amount.\n\nThe improvements are, in fact, so significant that they have once again\nmade the pulsejet a definite contender for specific low-end applications\nsuch as recreational vehicles (including microlight and homebuilt aircraft),\nmilitary drones, etc.\n\nThanks to the X-Jet design, it is now possible to sell a reliable\njet engine producing over 55Kgs (150lbs) of thrust and weighing under\n6.5KG (15 lbs) for less than US$1,000, more than 20 times cheaper\nthan the equivalent turbojet.\n\nAs a result of the information published on this website, I have already\nreceived a significant level of interest from people wanting to buy\none (or in some cases more) engines based on the X-Jet design, however\nmy resources are limited and at this stage I will continue to work\non further improving and refining the design rather than diverting my\nattentions to manufacturing activities.\n\nThis development is continuing thanks in part to a technology grant\nfrom the New Zealand government -- but additional investment capital will\nbe required to commercialize the engine for licensing and manufacture to\na global market.\n\nInquiries are welcomed from investors who may wish to participate in\ncommercializing this design and companies which may wish to manufacture\nthe engine in various sizes under license.", "url": "http://www.aardvark.co.nz/pjet/", "hostname": "www.aardvark.co.nz", "category": "uncategorized", "comment_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19211167"}, {"title": "RCModelReviews", "description": "This is the YouTube channel of http://www.RCModelReviews.com RC Model Reviews brings you totally objective, unbiased in-depth reviews of RC products that are...", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/user/RCModelReviews", "hostname": "www.youtube.com", "category": "uncategorized", "comment_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19212140"}, {"title": "Direct Listings Are a Thing Now", "description": "Also bathroom meetings, Sears CDS and bank culture.", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-01-11/direct-listings-are-a-thing-now", "hostname": "www.bloomberg.com", "category": "news", "comment_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19211621"}, {"title": "Would You Recognize a Dystopia If You Saw One?", "description": "Ryan J.

Because a key generation function must be deterministic so that the weak key always generates the same stretched key (called an enhanced key), the stretching of the key does not alter the entropy of the key-space, only complicates the method of computing the enhanced key. Attacks on unsalted key stretching functions exist called rainbow tables. Salting the key is the process of appending a long, random string to the weak key. This is done so that precomputed hashes of either short keys or password lists cannot be used in authentication schemes that require the hash to be presented or to reverse hashes into their original pass-phrases which may be used to compromise users on other services using the same pass-phrase.\n", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_stretching", "hostname": "en.wikipedia.org", "category": "wiki_article", "comment_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19209435"}, {"title": "About Password Iterations", "description": "To increase the security of your master password, LastPass utilizes a stronger-than-typical version of Password-Based Key Derivation Function (PBKDF2).

However, the optimal deformation state is buried within the vast continua of choices available in the strain space. Here we advance a unique and powerful strategy to circumvent conventional trial-and-error methods, and adopt artificial intelligence techniques for rationally designing the most energy-efficient pathway to achieve a desirable material property such as the electronic bandgap. The broad framework for tailoring any target figure of merit, for any material using machine learning, opens up opportunities to adapt elastic strain engineering of properties and performance in devices and systems in a controllable and efficient manner, for potential applications in microelectronics, optoelectronics, photonics, and energy technologies.\n\nNanoscale specimens of semiconductor materials as diverse as silicon and diamond are now known to be deformable to large elastic strains without inelastic relaxation. These discoveries harbinger a new age of deep elastic strain engineering of the band structure and device performance of electronic materials. Many possibilities remain to be investigated as to what pure silicon can do as the most versatile electronic material and what an ultrawide bandgap material such as diamond, with many appealing functional figures of merit, can offer after overcoming its present commercial immaturity. Deep elastic strain engineering explores full six-dimensional space of admissible nonlinear elastic strain and its effects on physical properties. Here we present a general method that combines machine learning and ab initio calculations to guide strain engineering whereby material properties and performance could be designed. This method invokes recent advances in the field of artificial intelligence by utilizing a limited amount of ab initio data for the training of a surrogate model, predicting electronic bandgap within an accuracy of 8 meV. Our model is capable of discovering the indirect-to-direct bandgap transition and semiconductor-to-metal transition in silicon by scanning the entire strain space. It is also able to identify the most energy-efficient strain pathways that would transform diamond from an ultrawide-bandgap material to a smaller-bandgap semiconductor. A broad framework is presented to tailor any target figure of merit by recourse to deep elastic strain engineering and machine learning for a variety of applications in microelectronics, optoelectronics, photonics, and energy technologies.", "url": "https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2019/02/14/1818555116", "hostname": "www.pnas.org", "category": "uncategorized", "comment_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19210174"}, {"title": "Why W.H.
