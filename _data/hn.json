It more than likely contains errors (hopefully not serious ones). Furthermore, its references to the literature are incomplete.  Your comments and suggestions to the author at \ndimitrib@mit.edu \nare welcome. \n\n The purpose of the book is to consider large and challenging multistage decision problems, which can be solved in principle by dynamic programming and optimal control, but their exact solution is computationally intractable. We discuss solution methods that rely on approximations to produce suboptimal policies with adequate performance. \nThese methods are collectively referred to as reinforcement learning, and also by alternative names such as approximate dynamic programming, and neuro-dynamic programming. \n\n Our subject has benefited enormously from the interplay of ideas from optimal control and from artificial intelligence. One of the aims of this monograph is to explore the common boundary between these  two fields and to form a bridge that is accessible by workers with background in either field.\n\n The mathematical style of the book is somewhat different from the author's dynamic programming books, and the neuro-dynamic programming monograph, written jointly with John Tsitsiklis. We rely more on intuitive explanations and less on proof-based insights. Still we provide a rigorous short account of the theory of finite and infinite horizon dynamic programming, and some basic approximation methods, in an appendix. For this we require a modest mathematical background: calculus, elementary probability, and a minimal use of matrix-vector algebra.\n\nThe methods of this book have been successful in practice, and often spectacularly so, as evidenced by recent amazing accomplishments in the games of chess and Go. However, across a wide range of problems, their performance properties may be less than solid. This is a reflection of the state of the art in the field: there are no methods that are guaranteed to work for all or even most problems, but there are enough methods to try on a given challenging problem with a reasonable chance that one or more of them will be successful in the end.\nAccordingly, we have aimed to present a broad range of methods that are based on sound principles, and to provide intuition into their properties, even when these properties do not include a solid performance guarantee. Hopefully, with enough  exploration with some of these methods and their variations, the reader will be able to address adequately his/her own  problem.\n\n \n BOOK PREFACE, CONTENTS, AND CHAPTERS\n \nClick here for preface and table of contents.\n Drafts of book chapters (periodically updated, check for latest versions):  \nChapter 1: Exact Dynamic Programming, \nChapter 2: Approximation in Value Space,\nChapter 3: Parametric Approximation, \nChapter 4: Infinite Horizon Reinforcement Learning,\nChapter 5: Aggregation,\nReferences.\n\n \nClick here for a slide overview presentation from Conference on Decision and Control, Dec. 2018.\n\n\n\n\n REINFORCEMENT LEARNING COURSE AT ASU: SLIDES AND VIDEO LECTURES\n Lecture slides for a course in Reinforcement Learning and Optimal Control (January 8-February 21, 2019), at Arizona State University: \n Slides-Lecture 1, Slides-Lecture 2, Slides-Lecture 3, Slides-Lecture 4, Slides-Lecture 5, Slides-Lecture 6, Slides-Lecture 7, Slides-Lecture 8, \nSlides-Lecture 9, \nSlides-Lecture 10, \nSlides-Lecture 11, \nSlides-Lecture 12, \nSlides-Lecture 13.\n\n Videos of lectures from Reinforcement Learning and Optimal Control course at Arizona State University: (Clisk around the screen to see JUST THE VIDEO, or JUST THE SLIDES, or BOTH SIMULTANEOUSLY).\n Video-Lecture 1, \nVideo-Lecture 2, Video-Lecture 3,Video-Lecture 4,\nVideo-Lecture 5,\nVideo-Lecture 6,\nVideo-Lecture 7,\nVideo-Lecture 8,\nVideo-Lecture 9,\nVideo-Lecture 10,\nVideo-Lecture 11,\nVideo-Lecture 12,\nVideo-Lecture 13.\n\n Lecture 13 is an overview of the entire course.\n\n \n\n\n Dynamic Programming and Optimal Control, Vol. 1, 4th Edition\n Dimitri P. \nBertsekas\n Published February 2017\n\n\n The fourth edition (February 2017) contains a\nsubstantial amount of new material, particularly on approximate DP in Chapter 6.

This is a major revision of Vol. II and contains a substantial amount of new material, as well as \na reorganization of old material. The length has increased by more than 60% from the third edition, and\nmost of the old material has been restructured and/or revised. Volume II  now numbers more than 700 pages and is larger in size than Vol. I. It can arguably be viewed as a new book! \n\n \nApproximate DP has become the central focal point of this volume, and occupies more than half of the book (the last two chapters, and large parts of Chapters 1-3). Thus one may also view this new edition as a followup of the author's 1996 book \"Neuro-Dynamic Programming\" (coauthored with John Tsitsiklis). A lot of new  material, the outgrowth of research  conducted in the six years since the previous edition, has been included. \n\n A new printing of the fourth edition (January 2018) contains some updated material, particularly on undiscounted problems in Chapter 4, and approximate DP in Chapter 6.

Coughlin/Governor's Office)\r\n\r\nAmazon’s decision to put a corporate campus in Long Island City after a year-long, somewhat-public search for a host city and a series of incentives from New York City and State has drawn skepticism and outrage in Queens and beyond for a number of reasons.\r\nSome activists and elected officials oppose the secretive process by which Amazon got its land, tax breaks and grant, others feel like the company isn’t a corporate entity the city and state should be welcoming because of labor, political and other practices. But all of the opponents to the Amazon deal seem to agree that that package of roughly $3 billion in incentives the trillion-dollar corporation is getting from New York is out of bounds, an inappropriate giveaway based on old economics, in the midst of both a strong overall city economy with low unemployment on one hand and affordable housing, public housing, and transportation crises on the other.\r\nAnd while a look at the programs in question reveals that Amazon doesn’t appear to be getting tax incentives or breaks that wouldn’t be available to other large employers who set up shop in New York, economists and budget watchdogs suggest the outrage over the tax break package Amazon is getting presents an opportunity to reexamine New York’s use of subsidies to entice companies. (Note: there is one discretionary capital grant in the deal for roughly $500 million that is separate from the $2.5 billion in city and state tax incentives.)\r\nWhere does the money come from? The three largest incentives Amazon is getting from New York come from three as-of-right (that is, incentives available to any company that meets the requirements) programs: the Excelsior Jobs Credit Tax Program, the Relocation and Expansion Assistance Program (REAP) and the Industrial and Commercial Abatement Program (ICAP). The latter two tax breaks are incentives established by the state government that affect the city tax rolls, while the former program affects state tax rolls.\r\n“They’re state created, like 421-a,” John Kaehny, the Executive Director of Reinvent Albany, told Gotham Gazette about ICAP and REAP, with reference to the tax break known as 421-a that seeks to incent housing development with some affordability included. “So the New York City Department of Finance administers them, but they have to, they're made to by state law. Basically it's money that the state is directing be taken out of the city's tax revenue.”\r\nAlong with their as-of-right nature, all three programs require a company actually delivers jobs in order to take advantage of the breaks. In that sense, Amazon is no different from a hotel company or mobile phone infrastructure company or real estate company in applying for the programs. In the case of the Excelsior program, Amazon is taking advantage of a refundable tax credit equal to 6.85 percent of the total wages per new full-time job they create, and a capital investment credit equal to 2 percent of a company’s total qualified investments that result in new jobs.\r\nFor the city tax breaks, ICAP is a tax abatement program that may last up to 25 years, available to companies who undertake new commercial construction in areas outside of some exempted sections of Manhattan. It appears Amazon will be eligible for a 15-year ICAP that begins to decline in year 12. REAP is a per-job tax credit in which companies from either outside New York City or below 96th Street in Manhattan get a $3,000 per employee credit for 12 years for each employee that moves into the new office outside the REAP area.\r\nIn addition to the above programs, Amazon is also getting a cash grant from the state called an Empire State Development Capital Grant that’s potentially worth $505 million and is supposed to help defray some of the costs from building the new corporate campus. And because New York State is taking over the land where the office will be located and making it tax-exempt, Amazon will make payments in lieu of taxes (PILOTs) that the city has said will be equal to the property tax bill the company would pay on the land otherwise. Half of the money from the PILOT will go to the city’s general fund, and half of it will go towards infrastructure improvements around Long Island City.\r\nAll told, the tax breaks from the jobs credit, ICAP and REAP and the capital grant could wind up adding up to $3 billion in incentives to Amazon, if the company delivers the 25,000 jobs it’s promised over the course of 10 years.\r\nWhat’s the problem exactly?In his media appearances and statements to defend the incentive package, Governor Cuomo has suggested that these kinds of tax breaks are just the cost of doing business in America. But some economists, like James Parrott, the Director of Economic and Fiscal Policies at the Center for New York Affairs, say the programs are working off of a somewhat dated economic model, especially since he found that the city gave up almost $6 billion in tax revenue in Fiscal Year 2018 thanks to a stew of incentive programs like ICAP and REAP.\r\nThe predecessors to ICAP and REAP arrived in “a different historical economic context, coming on the heels of the 1970s when there was a lot of corporate headquarters movement out of New York City,” Parrott told Gotham Gazette. “With the loss of 600,000 jobs between 1973 and 1979, it was a really difficult economic period for the city. So in the 1980s the city put in place, and ramped up its commitment to subsidize corporations to stay in New York City, to relocate to New York City and to add employment.” But these days, Parrott says the city’s economy is healthy enough to function without massive incentives.\r\n“We're now at a point where the total employment level in New York City is 4.3 million, almost 700,000 to 800,000 higher than it's ever been before,” he said. “Arguably New York City doesn't need to do anything to subsidize new economic development investments, given the very rapid employment growth we've had in recent years.”\r\nThough he continues to stress that his administration refuses cash grants to companies, de Blasio also continues to defend the Amazon deal, including the use of the subsidies involved, again doing both during his weekly NY1 appearance on Monday. “[W[hat we need to move towards is a society where it’s not about cities competing” over companies, the mayor told host Errol Louis. “The specific incentives were automatic and part of state law,” was also part of his defense, and he suggested that if people want to see an end to the as-of-right programs, people should debate that in the future.\r\nParrott said he could understand the use of the Excelsior programs upstate, given the region’s struggling economy and what he said was a better oversight process than the program’s predecessor, the extremely troubled and criticized Empire Zone program. But the entire program also has an annual cap ($183 million in 2019 and steadily decreasing to $36 million in 2024 per the Citizens Budget Commission) that will have to be raised by the state Legislature if Amazon creates all of the jobs it’s promised, leaving Parrott to wonder, “why on Earth, if you have these limited tax credit resources, you spend those in New York City? The one place in the state that that least needs economic development subsidies?”\r\nKaehny sees some self-promotion as a motivating factor in giving state money to Amazon, specifically on the part of the governor. “Cuomo wants to create a narrative that shows that he had some agency, that he was the one that closed this deal with Amazon, that he did something that caused this deal to happen,” Kaehny said. “If Amazon says, ‘Well we don't care about the subsidies at all, we really just wanted New York City and this terrific dynamic place with a huge job market of talented people, the kind that we want working for Amazon and we don't really need subsidies,’ well then what's Cuomo’s role in landing the deal?”\r\nIt’s an especially pertinent question according to Kaehny and others who insist that Amazon was probably going to come to New York anyway. Both before and after identifying Long Island City as one of its landing spots, Amazon officials said that the ease of recruiting tech talent was the key ingredient in their search. A request for information that Amazon sent to Somerville, Massachusetts included one question about the incentive package the city could offer, but multiple questions about quality of life and the area’s working populations.\r\nThat in turn raises the issue of where New York should actually invest, in businesses or in infrastructure, according to Jonas Shaende, the chief economist at the Fiscal Policy Institute. “Should we just give [companies] tax subsidies outright or should we invest in what makes New York so attractive and so vibrant and so great? In the things that that are the real factors in in their decision making, things like the transportation system, the affordable housing the access to to labor, to education facilities those kinds of things.”\r\nShaende wasn’t alone in that line of thinking, as redirecting state subsidies from corporations towards local infrastructure was a centerpiece of the Marc Molinaro and Stephanie Miner campaigns for governor.\r\nIt’s real money Another one of the governor’s defenses of the incentive package is that New York isn’t actually paying Amazon anything at all, but rather is letting the company pay slightly less in taxes than it would otherwise. In his “op-ed” published to the governor’s official website, Cuomo writes:\r\n“Our proposal offered that, when and if those revenues are realized, the government would effectively reduce their $1 billion payment by about $100 million for a net to New York of approximately $900 million. New York doesn't give Amazon $100 million. Amazon gives New York $900 million.”\r\nIt’s a rhetorical sleight of hand that doesn’t pass muster with any expert Gotham Gazette spoke to. “I mean, that's just fundamentally wrong because essentially all economists left, right, wherever agree that a tax abatement or tax credit is a form of expenditure by government and is rightly called a subsidy,” Kaehny said, pointing out that the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (which sets the rules for financial reporting by government entities) now has a rule that counts subsidies as expenditures.\r\nAnd in the case of the capital grant Amazon is getting, the cash is very much real. “It's clearly a case where it's a budget choice [Cuomo's] making, here's $500 million in taxpayer resources we're going to give to Amazon rather than use it for something else,” Parrott said.\r\n“[Cuomo] happens to have a reserve of resources, out of which it’s very likely that this money is going to come,” Parrott said, talking about New York settlements reached with banks who are alleged to have committed mortgage securities and other financial fraud. “Although there wasn't anything said in the memorandum of understanding with [Empire State Development] and the state and the city that said where the capital monies are going to come from, my guess is it will come out of the reserve,” he said. Cuomo has indicated he does not need legislative approval for the capital grant, but legislators, especially those opposing the deal like Queens state Senator Michael Gianaris, are exploring all their options to block or change the deal.\r\nThe Citizens Budget Commission was measured in its critique of the grant, comparing the reimbursement-style payments as better than upfront costs the state has taken on with, for instance, the $750 million solar panel plant it built in Buffalo. But CBC still criticized the ongoing lack of oversight for where the money would come from. The grant has also been criticized in multiple corners as a sop to Cuomo-friendly construction unions, with critics charging the state is essentially paying Amazon to use union labor.\r\nAnd the subsidies also open New York up to the double whammy of even more companies asking for the kinds of tax breaks Amazon is set to receive while at the same time trying to provide services and pay for them in a state budget operating under the governor’s self-imposed 2 percent cap on annual spending increases.\r\n“It’s not a fiscally responsible way of running government,” Shaende said. “It could be potentially highly problematic for the state, because the state still relies on taxes. And we have the 2 percent spending growth cap, we have all sorts of measures that that the governor adopted to show that he's running a very fiscally responsible shop. He saves money, let's say, by cutting services, by finding efficiencies, in joint services between municipalities. So he saves, you know, a couple of nickels here a couple of dimes over there, and then he just splurges like this.”\r\nCould this spur change? As lawmakers scramble to find a way to stop or change Amazon’s incentive package, there’s at least some hope among reformers that the publicity surrounding the deal can lead to a change in how the state and city use tax incentives. The incentives all going towards one company has already brought more attention to the ways New York uses them than their use for the Hudson Yards development, Parrott said, despite the fact that “the total cost of the Hudson Yards tax breaks rival the amount of the city and state subsidy to Amazon.”\r\nThe surrounding outrage may also give new life to the proposed subsidy tracker known as the “Database of Deals,” an idea that Reinvent Albany’s Alex Camarda pointed out “is not rocket science” in Assembly testimony for more accountability in the state’s economic development funds last year. It is a transparency measure Comptroller Tom DiNapoli has called for but Cuomo has opposed; it passed the Republican-led state Senate earlier this year, but was not given a vote in the Democrat-led Assembly.\r\nAccording to Shonede, the database not only could provide transparency to what’s going on in the state, but a better template for future spending.\r\n“As a community of experts, we need to stress some basic accountability, how many jobs we get per dollar spent, and what kind of jobs they are,” Shoende told Gotham Gazette. “And if we do that, in a consistent and serious way, a basic accounting of these efforts, it’s going to be obvious that the best way to improve the situation with income inequality, and lack of good jobs in vulnerable communities and improving the business climate have to do with what the traditional role of the government is supposed to be. And that is making sure that people are safe, that they are well prepared for the market, and that the infrastructure is such that it minimizes the business costs for the businesses that you see operate in the neighborhoods,” he said.\r\nAnd so in his own way, despite resisting intensive oversight of the state’s economic development initiatives, the governor may have inadvertently dragged the state’s subsidy programs further towards daylight. “This is kind of a like peeling the onion of Albany dysfunction and scurviness in a microcosm, this deal,” said Kaehny. “Because there's all this stuff baked in here that's been going on for a long time time. But it's like for the first time people in New York City were like ‘Oh s***,’ but reality is they've been doing this for many, many years.”\r\n\n\n\n\t*** by Dave Colon, Gotham Gazette@DavecoIon     @GothamGazette\r\nRead more by this writer.\n\r\nNote: this article has been updated with more clear description of Amazon's eligibility for ICAP.", "url": "http://www.gothamgazette.com/state/8110-a-closer-look-at-the-tax-incentives-in-the-amazon-deal", "hostname": "www.gothamgazette.com", "category": "uncategorized", "comment_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19235784"}, {"title": "Google to Build $1 Billion NYC Campus, No Tax Incentives Required", "description": "There’s about to be a lot more Googlers in Manhattan.", "url": "http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/12/google-to-invest-usd1-billion-in-nyc-no-tax-incentives-needed.html", "hostname": "nymag.com", "category": "uncategorized", "comment_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19235924"}, {"title": "Google Plans Large New York City Expansion", "description": "Google is gearing up for an expansion of its New York City real estate that could add space for more than 12,000 new workers, an amount nearly double the search giant’s current staffing in the city.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-plans-large-new-york-city-expansion-1541636579", "hostname": "www.wsj.com", "category": "news", "comment_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19235924"}, {"title": "A Case for a New Language · pl-rants", "description": "\n       Rants about programming languages \n      ", "url": "https://pl-rants.net/posts/case-for-new-lang/", "hostname": "pl-rants.net", "category": "uncategorized", "comment_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19231932"}, {"title": "dhall-lang/dhall-lang", "description": "A configuration language guaranteed to terminate.

This let us ask, \"if we were doing it all\nagain...what would we want it to look like?\"\n\nWhile designing the new driver, we drew a lot of inspiration from our\nnewer Vulkan driver, as well as a few other Gallium drivers.\n\nKey Changes\n-----------\n\n* All new state upload code is dramatically more efficient.\n\n  In CPU overhead microbenchmarks, Iris can issue on average\n  3 times as many draw calls per second as our i965 driver.\n\n* Supports only Broadwell and newer (Gen8+); drops support for\n  the older Gen4-7.5 GPUs, as well as Braswell/Cherrytrail.\n\n* Updated memory management takes full advantage of modern PPGTT\n  support, allocating VMA in userspace for greater control, and\n  allowing us to pre-bake state containing addresses.\n\n* Requires a modern Linux kernel (v4.16+, could be v4.5 if needed).\n\n* Leverages Mesa's \"Gallium\" driver framework, allowing us to share\n  more code and development effort with the rest of the community.\n\nWhile many pieces are new, much of the driver remains the same.\nWe continue using these components of our existing stack:\n\n* The Mesa OpenGL API front-end\n* The Mesa shader compiler (GLSL, SPIR-V, NIR, i965 Gen-assembly backend)\n* The Intel Surface Layout (ISL) library\n* The Intel Blit-on-Render-Pipe (BLORP) library\n* The i965 auxiliary surface resolve tracker\n* The i965 buffer manager (extended, but largely reused)\n\nQ&A\n---\n\nQ: How do I build and use Iris?\n\nIris only supports the Meson and Android build systems (sorry, no\nAutotools or SCons support).  To build Iris, use -Dgallium-drivers=iris\nwhen running Meson.  -Ddri-drivers=i965 will also build i965.\n\ni965 remains the default driver (assuming it's built).  You can try\nout Iris on a per-application basis by setting an environment variable:\n\n   $ export MESA_LOADER_DRIVER_OVERRIDE=iris\n\nPlease note that Iris requires a modern kernel, such as 4.19+.\n\nQ: Should I use Iris yet?\n\nIris is not considered stable or ready for production use - it's still\nvery experimental.  However, it is largely feature complete (a few less\ncommonly-used features are missing), and is passing roughly 99% of the\nPiglit test suite and OpenGL CTS.  We have not done extensive testing\nor benchmarking of games and applications yet.\n\nIf you're feeling adventurous, feel free to try it out and report\nissues at https://bugs.freedesktop.org/ under product Mesa and the\nDrivers/Gallium/Iris component.  Or ask us on IRC (irc.freenode.net\nchannel #intel-3d).\n\nQ: Are there any known issues?\n\n* Currently, Glamor rendering, and shaders using gl_VertexID, may not\n  work correctly.  This will be fixed shortly after merging.\n\n* GPU reset support is poor - if it hangs, it will likely hang\n  repeatedly until the kernel bans it.  Chris Wilson and I are\n  working on a solution for this.\n\n* There is a known kernel memory leak in some 4.18 kernels, which\n  Iris can provoke.  The fix has already been backported, but a few\n  distros didn't pick it up before moving on to 4.19+.  Please use\n  the latest available kernel.\n\n* Performance is expected to be slower than i965 for the moment, in\n  many cases, but this will improve in the days to come.  There are\n  still a number of stall avoidance paths which have not been hooked\n  up yet, which can lead to the GPU idling.  Fast clears support is\n  missing, and end-to-end color compression is not working yet.\n\n  We expect it to be faster in the long run, and it already is in\n  some particular cases.  For one customer, Iris is 18% faster than\n  i965.  Your mileage may vary until the driver matures a bit more.\n\nQ: What's with the commit history?\n\nThe commit history in this merge request is largely the actual\nnon-idealized history for bringing up the driver, rather than the\ntidy patch series we're used to seeing.  I decided that preserving\nthe history mostly as-is might be of interest to other people who\nare considering bringing up a new driver, to see how I did it.\nAlso, after a year of work, I wanted to be able to fairly attribute\npeople's work, and squashing it would not have done that justice.\n\nDuring development, I rebased the driver on master periodically.\nAt the end, I went back and ensured that the driver would at least\ncompile at each step, so that people can bisect across it without\nas many issues.  I also squashed some obvious fixup commits.  But\nit's largely still the original history.\n\nQ: Who developed Iris?\n\nAccording to git shortlog, the following people contributed patches\nto Iris which made it into the original MR:\n\n    Kenneth Graunke (732)\n    Jordan Justen (14)\n    Dave Airlie (13)\n    Chris Wilson (12)\n    Rafael Antognolli (8)\n    Jason Ekstrand (7)\n    Caio Marcelo de Oliveira Filho (3)\n    Andre Heider (2)\n    Rhys Kidd (1)\n    Sagar Ghuge (1)\n    Tapani PÃ¤lli (1)\n    Timur KristÃ³f (1)\n\nThis understates the work, however, as we've reused a lot of code\nfrom our existing drivers and infrastructure, so my thanks to the\nwhole Intel Mesa team, and the entire Mesa community.  Particular\nthanks to Dave Airlie, Ilia Mirkin, Marek OlÅ¡Ã¡k, and Eric Anholt,\nand others for answering a lot of questions about Gallium.\n\nIn any list of acknowledgments, I am sure to have missed people;\nsorry for the omission, and thank you nonetheless!\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: signature.asc\nType: application/pgp-signature\nSize: 833 bytes\nDesc: This is a digitally signed message part.\nURL: <https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/mesa-dev/attachments/20190220/51f78fed/attachment-0001.sig>\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious message (by thread): [Mesa-dev] [Bug 109532] ir_variable has maximum access out of bounds -- but it's not out of bounds\n\nNext message (by thread): [Mesa-dev] [Bug 109698] dri.pc contents invalid when built with meson\n\n Messages sorted by:\n[ date ]\n[ thread ]\n[ subject ]\n[ author ]\n\n\n\nMore information about the mesa-dev\nmailing list\n", "url": "https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/mesa-dev/2019-February/215576.html", "hostname": "lists.freedesktop.org", "category": "uncategorized", "comment_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19233045"}, {"title": "CRXcavator: Democratizing Chrome Extension Security", "description": "To provide users and IT teams with actionable intelligence about Chrome extensions, Duo Labs is excited to announce the public beta of CRXcavator (rhymes with “excavator”), a free service that analyzes Chrome extensions and produces comprehensive security reports.", "url": "https://duo.com/blog/crxcavator", "hostname": "duo.com", "category": "uncategorized", "comment_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19217035"}, {"title": "Inside the Rise and Fall of a Multimillion-Dollar Airbnb Scheme", "description": "Multiple misleading identities, more than 100 host accounts and 18 corporations were created to run an illegal hotel business in Manhattan, according to a lawsuit filed by the city.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/23/nyregion/airbnb-nyc-law.html", "hostname": "www.nytimes.com", "category": "news", "comment_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19235297"}, {"title": "Steel frame - Wikipedia", "description": "Steel frame is a building technique with a \"skeleton frame\" of vertical steel columns and horizontal I-beams, constructed in a rectangular grid to support the floors, roof and walls of a building which are all attached to the frame.
