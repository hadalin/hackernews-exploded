The boundary between work life and home life has shrunk with the introduction of digital tools into employment. While digital tools bring flexibility and freedom to employees they also can create an absence of limits, leading to excessive interference in the private lives of employees.[3] For this reason such a right is beneficial. Several countries, primarily in Europe, have some form of the right to disconnect included in their law, while in some cases it is present in the policy of many large companies. On July 24, 2018, the Petition 1057 called for introduction of the right to disconnect or as it is called in French “Le droit à la déconnexion” in the Labour Law in Luxembourg.[4]", "url": "https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_disconnect", "hostname": "en.m.wikipedia.org", "category": "wiki_article", "comment_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19221321"}, {"title": "Outline - Read & annotate without distractions", "description": "Outline is a free service for reading and annotating news articles.

[1][2] Proponents of this view seem to overlook the fact that, the notion of legal private property rights only exists within the legal framework of the state. [3] Without a source of income, the state would be unable to enforce property law, and legal concepts such as theft and property rights, would essentially be rendered meaningless. Therefore it can be argued that the \"taxation is theft\" view is self-defeating unless the state can generate income through other means than taxation, such as state-owned business enterprises, or if the state is wholly paid for and operated by volunteers. \nVoluntaryists, anarcho-capitalists, as well as Objectivists and most minarchists and libertarians see taxation as a clear violation of the non-aggression principle.[4]\n", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxation_as_theft#How_many_men?", "hostname": "en.wikipedia.org", "category": "wiki_article", "comment_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19221025"}, {"title": "Here's why we're entering the Golden Age of Podcasts (in 10 graphs)", "description": "Spotify's acquisition of Gimlet Media and Anchor signals the beginning of the Golden Age of Podcasts.

For now, this guide is still the most complete and best reviewed.  Any contributions to the new guide are welcome via GitHub forks. This guide aims to aid people interested in learning to work with BASH.  It aspires to teach good practice techniques for using BASH, and writing simple scripts. This guide is targeted at beginning users.  It assumes no advanced knowledge -- just the ability to login to a Unix-like system and open a command-line (terminal) interface.  It will help if you know how to use a text editor; we will not be covering editors, nor do we endorse any particular editor choice.  Familiarity with the fundamental Unix tool set, or with other programming languages or programming concepts, is not required, but those who have such knowledge may understand some of the examples more quickly. If something is unclear to you, you are invited to report this (use BashGuideFeedback, or the #bash channel on irc.freenode.org) so that it may be clarified in this document for future readers. You are invited to contribute to the development of this document by extending it or correcting invalid or incomplete information. The primary maintainer(s) of this document: -- Lhunath (primary author) -- GreyCat The guide is also available in PDF format. Alternatively, you can just hit print after going to FullBashGuide.  That guarantees you'll be printing the latest version of this document.   \nA Definition\nBASH is an acronym for Bourne Again Shell.  It is based on the Bourne shell and is mostly compatible with its features. Shells are command interpreters.  They are applications that provide users with the ability to give commands to their operating system interactively, or to execute batches of commands quickly.  In no way are they required for the execution of programs; they are merely a layer between system function calls and the user. Think of a shell as a way for you to speak to your system.  Your system doesn't need it for most of its work, but it is an excellent interface between you and what your system can offer.  It allows you to perform basic math, run basic tests and execute applications.  More importantly, it allows you to combine these operations and connect applications to each other to perform complex and automated tasks. BASH is not your operating system.  It is not your window manager.  It is not your terminal (but it oftens runs inside your terminal).  It does not control your mouse or keyboard.  It does not configure your system, activate your screensaver, or open your files when you double-click them.  It is generally not involved in launching applications from your window manager or desktop environment.  It's important to understand that BASH is only an interface for you to execute statements (using BASH syntax), either at the interactive BASH prompt or via BASH scripts.  In The Manual: Introduction  Shell: A (possibly interactive) command interpreter, acting as a layer between the user and the system. \nBash: The Bourne Again Shell, a Bourne compatible shell.   \nUsing Bash\nMost users that think of BASH think of it as a prompt and a command line.  That is BASH in interactive mode.  BASH can also run in non-interactive mode, as when executing scripts.  We can use scripts to automate certain logic.  Scripts are basically lists of commands (just like the ones you can type on the command line), but stored in a file.  When a script is executed, all these commands are (generally) executed sequentially, one after another. We'll start with the basics in an interactive shell. Once you're familiar with those, you can put them together in scripts. Important! \n You should make yourself familiar with the man and apropos commands on the shell.  They will be vital to your self-tutoring. $ man man\n$ man aproposIn this guide, the $ at the beginning of a line represents your BASH prompt.  Traditionally, a shell prompt either ends with $, % or #.  If it ends with $, this indicates a shell that's compatible with the Bourne shell (such as a POSIX shell, or a Korn shell, or Bash).  If it ends with %, this indicates a C shell (csh or tcsh); this guide does not cover C shell.  If it ends with #, this indicates that the shell is running as the system's superuser account (root), and that you should be extra careful. Your actual BASH prompt will probably be much longer than $.  Prompts are often highly individualized. The man command stands for \"manual\"; it opens documentation (so-called \"man pages\") on various topics.  You use it by running the command man [topic] at the BASH prompt, where [topic] is the name of the \"page\" you wish to read.  Note that many of these \"pages\" are considerably longer than one printed page; nevertheless, the name persists.  Each command (application) on your system is likely to have a man page.  There are pages for other things too, such as system calls or specific configuration files.  In this guide, we will only be covering commands. Note that if you're looking for information on BASH built-ins (commands provided by BASH, not by external applications) you should look in man bash instead.  BASH's manual is extensive and detailed.  It is an excellent reference, albeit more technical than this guide. Bash also offers a help command which contains brief summaries of its built-in commands (which we'll discuss in depth later on). $ help\n$ help read In the FAQ: \nIs there a list of which features were added to specific releases (versions) of Bash?  Interactive mode: A mode of operation where a prompt asks you for one command at a time. Script: A file that contains a sequence of commands to execute one after the other.  \nContents\nThe guide has been divided into sections, which are intended to be read roughly in the order presented.

Early results from research at the University of California, Davis, indicate that just a touch of the ocean algae in cattle feed could dramatically cut greenhouse gas emissions from California’s 1.8 million dairy cows.\n\n“This is a very surprising and promising development,” said animal science professor and Sesnon Endowed Chair Ermias Kebreab inside the UC Davis dairy barn where he is testing seaweed efficacy with 12 Holstein cows. “Results are not final, but so far we are seeing substantial emission reductions. This could help California’s dairy farmers meet new methane-emission standards and sustainably produce the dairy products we need to feed the world.”\n\nKebreab’s project is the first to test seaweed on live dairy cattle anywhere in the world.\n\nHis team will publish preliminary findings in late June and begin further tests with additional cattle later this summer.\nProfessor Ermias Kebreab with the UC Davis Department of Animal Science is conducting research with dairy cows to find out if seaweed will reduce methane emissions from cattle. Results are promising, but not final.\n\nA question of digestion\n\nCows and other “ruminant” animals like goats and sheep burp continuously throughout the day as they digest food in their rumen, the first of four sections of their stomachs. The rumen is home to millions of microbes that help ferment and break down high-fiber food like grass and hay. This fermentation produces gases that combine to form methane, an especially potent heat-trapping gas.\n\nSo, as cattle perpetually burp and exhale, they emit methane. Cows also pass methane gas from the other end, but to a much lesser degree. Manure, too, is a source of methane emissions.\n\nIn an effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, California legislators recently adopted regulations requiring dairy farmers and other producers to cut methane emissions 40 percent by 2030.\n\n“Since much of a dairy’s methane emissions come from the animal itself, nutrition can play a big role in finding solutions,” said Kebreab.\n\nMolasses, please  \n\nTesting supplements in cattle feed is not new. Kebreab and his colleagues at UC Davis and beyond are finding varying degrees of success with a wide range of feed additives. Some compounds work in the lab with simulated cattle digestive systems, but not with live animals. Researchers in England, for example, found success with curry supplements until they tested it with live cattle.\n\n“The cows didn’t like the curry,” Kebreab said.\n\nDuring lab tests last year, researchers in Australia found that just 2 percent seaweed in cattle feed could reduce methane emissions by 99 percent. The seaweed apparently inhibits an enzyme that contributes to methane production.\n\n \nJudging from the reaction of the UC Davis cows, the seaweed is so far, so good — especially when cut with a bit of molasses.\n\n“The molasses masks the smell,” Kebreab said, smiling as two Holsteins nudged a gate that opens when it’s time for their next meal. “They enjoy their feed.”\n\nTo test seaweed efficacy, Kebreab and animal nutrition graduate student Breanne Roque have separated 12 cows into three groups. Two groups are fed with different doses of seaweed, and one group’s feed has no seaweed at all. They rotate through the two-week feeding regimens with a weeklong seaweed fast in between.   \n\nFour times a day, cows get a snack from an open-air contraption that measures the methane in their breath as they eat the treat.\n An open-air device measures the methane in the cows’ breath as they eat a treat. (Gregory Urquiaga/UC Davis)“The numbers we’re seeing are amazing — well beyond the target that farmers will need to reach,” Kebreab said.\n\nThroughout the seaweed diet, the cows’ milk is tested for qualities like yield, flavor and nutritional content.  \n\nA love of milk \n\nSustainable dairy production is not just an academic endeavor for Kebreab. He has loved milk since he was a young boy growing up in Eritrea, a country in the Horn of Africa.\n\n“I was always amazed at how an animal that eats grass can produce such a high-quality food,” Kebreab said. “And I loved the taste. We didn’t get that much — maybe once or twice a week. I wondered, can we find a way to produce enough milk for everyone?”\n\nKebreab is trying. Among his many projects, Kebreab recently received a $500,000 grant to help improve sustainable livestock production in Ethiopia and Burkina Faso, where dairy cattle produce 5 to 10 liters of milk per day compared to the 45 liters that cows in California can produce. He is working with researchers and funding from the University of Florida with support from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\n“By improving the quality and quantity of dairy production in developing countries, we help families rise from poverty and malnutrition, and also reduce the carbon footprint of cattle worldwide,” Kebreab said.\n\nIf seaweed proves to be a climate-smart supplement, producing it could be environmentally friendly, too. As Kebreab notes, “Growing seaweed doesn’t require land, fresh water or fertilizer.”\nA small amount of macro red algae, a type of seaweed pictured here, is mixed with molasses and cattle feed in a research project by UC Davis Professor Ermias Kebreab.
