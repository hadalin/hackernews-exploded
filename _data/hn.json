(Christopher Galpin in 2014 links to a number of other interesting analyses; John Kern in 2006 does Bayesian analysis for Pass the Pigs.) They rolled and tallied by hand.\nSkip to:\n\nHardware: Die Rolling Machine\nSoftware: Computer Vision\nLicense: cc-nc-4.0\nComments\n\nSee the Github repository for the scripts used to process image data from test runs, and data for each die tested. The source data for these charts is shared on Google Drive, including full image data for one die.\nResults\nOverview\n\nSmaller standard deviation is better, and expected values closer to 10½ are better (meaning \"fairer\" in both cases).\nExpected value is the average roll; for an ideal, fair d20 this is 10½, so the graph shows most of the tested d20s are slightly unlucky. However this graph doesn't tell you about specific roll outcomes (like 20s or 1s).\nThe standard deviation is on the normalized frequencies of the rolls for a die; thus a d20 where all sides have ideal (1.0) frequency has a standard deviation of 0.0, whereas dice with more variation have higher standard deviations.\n\nTrends within brands are discussed below, but it appears that across brands d20s (with most showing a standard deviation above 0.10) are less fair than dice with fewer sides.\nHow Many Rolls?\n100-150 rolls per die face.\nThe below data is from an opaque purple Wiz Dice d20, rolled 8000 times.\n\nThe different datasets are from random subsamples of the actual rolled sequence. So the blue series labeled \"100\" is from taking 100 random rolls from the set of 8000, and charting the relative normalized frequency of each side within that subsample; similarly for the other sample counts.\n\"Normalized Frequency\" is used so Y values on different histograms / for different dice can be compared easily. For example, an ideal fair d20 rolled 3000 times would show each face 150 times. So if a 20 actually comes up 102 times, the normalized frequency is 0.68. That is, in the example 20s showed up 68% of the times you would expect from a fair die. And frequencies of 1.0 correspond to what would be expected of a fair die.\nThe relative side frequencies for 1000 rolls or (especially) 100 rolls are fairly different from the frequencies at 8000 rolls. But anything from 2000 up looks fairly close. Thus I conclude that 2000 rolls is probably sufficient, and for good measure 3000 rolls should give a good picture of the die's behavior; this implies 100-150 rolls per side.\nFor a Crystal Caste clear black d8, rolled 3000 times:\n\nIn this case, with 512 samples the frequencies look somewhat different from those at 3000 samples, but with 1024 it's fairly close.\nThis leads me to a heuristic of 100 rolls per side (800 for a d8, 2000 for a d20). It is of course a subjective heuristic.\nChessex\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Chessex dice I tested: I bought a 7-die Copper-Steel Gemini set and a bag of 6 d20s (from which I tested a red, yellow and purple/gray die), and borrowed another d20 (green, probably 1990s purchase date).\n\nThe Chessex d20s are all mid-range fairness. The older borrowed green die (probably 1990s) proving fairer. (The rest were all purchased in 2015.) They seem to roughly favor and avoid the same numbers which, on the dice, are arranged like the two sewn halves of a baseball.\nOn these dice (as with most d20s), physically opposite faces sum to 21 (1 and 20, 2 and 19, etc). The distribution of frequencies is fairly symmetric around 10½, possibly as a result, which prevents the expected value of the die from deviating too far from 10½.\nWiz Dice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Wiz dice I tested: Dice from two sets out of a highcitybooks.com 35-die set; and three borrowed dice. (Note that highcitybooks is as of 2015 November selling Chessex, but historically sells bulk dice from multiple brands.)\n\n\n\n\n\nThese Wiz Dice were highly variable, but do tend to have symmetrical distributions around 10½ (like Chessex). In this small sample, the translucent dice were less fair than the opaques.\nGame Science\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Game Science dice I tested: two individual d20s; one black with gold numerals, and one white with black. (Just for fun, I've put the white one on eBay.) I tested the black d20 both before and after trimming a molding bump (left and right images above, respectively; the trimmed bump is at the right of the edge between 7 and 4). Game Science promotes its dice as especially fair.\n\nThe dice require trimming after they arrive. The two dice did both arrive with visible bumps. I tested the black die before and after trimming it, and saw a significant improvement in fairness, in fact leaving the black Game Science d20 as the fairest d20 tested (with a standard deviation of 0.07, up from 0.12, and a Chi Squared value of 0.76). But the black die's expected value was 10.38 before trimming and 10.37 afterwards (compared to 10.5 for an ideal fair d20). However the white d20 after trimming was only run-of-the-mill (standard deviation of 0.12).\nUnlike other dice tested (including the white d20), the black d20 very quickly became marred (possibly from hitting the LEDs mounted inside the rolling machine).\nThe white d20's expected value of 10.67 makes it one of the luckiest dice tested.\nCrystal Caste\n\n\n\n\nThe Crystal Caste dice I tested: hybrid translucent orange and black/white translucent.\n\nCrystal Caste's d20s were by far the least fair tested. The orange d20 (above) was visibly egg-shaped: longest diameter 19.77mm between 4 and 17, shortest diameter 18.98mm between 1 and 20. The two d20s do follow a similar distribution, and both have slightly low expected values, 10.18 and 10.24.\n\n\n\n\nI also compared one \"Crystal\" die to its platonic solid counterpart.\n\nCrystal Caste says the \"Cyrstal Dice\" are \"A totally new shape for RPG polyhedral dice: geometric cyrstals with sides of exactly the same size, guaranteeing random numbers.\" However their \"crystal\" d6 compared very poorly to their own cube d6 from another set (standard deviations of 0.25 and 0.05 respectively). (Their standard-shaped d8 also performed fairly well with a standard deviation of 0.09.)\nKoplow\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Koplow dice I tested: three dice from a set of 10 d20s.\n\nUnlike the other d20s, the opposing sides on Koplow d20s do not all sum to 21. The pairs are: 1/20 2/12 3/17 4/16 5/19 6/14 7/13 8/18 9/15 10/11.\nGeometric Analysis\nFollowing the example of 1000d4.com, I measured the distances between opposite sides of several d20s using digital calipers. Below is a comparison of those measurements and observed rolls.\n\nThe Crystal Caste (above) and Koplow (below) d20s clearly have some correlation between diameters and observed frequencies.\nAs an example, take sides 7 and 14, which are opposite each other on the Crystal Caste translucent orange d20 (graph above). The mean diameter of the die (the average distance from the center of one face to the center of its opposite face) is 19.43mm. The distance between 7 and 14 is 19.20mm, 0.23mm shorter than average (rendered as positive on the graph for easy comparison with roll frequencies). And in this case the compressed dimension correlates with both of those sides coming up more often than average (1.39 and 1.13 respectively).\n\n\nThe Wiz Dice (above) and Game Science (below) d20s have some correlation between diameters and frequencies, but (especially for the fairer Game Science die) not to the extent that diameters are a reliable predictor of observed rolls.\n\nHardware Setup (Die Roller and Camera)\n\nA microcontroller runs a servo motor to shake a small tub, and triggers a camera to take pictures. More details: Arduino sketch and hardware parts list.\n\nConstruction\nThe main container is an empty (and well washed) ice cream carton, chosen for its flat bottom and sloping sides. The servo motor's arm is taped to the side, and a paperclip makes the pivot on the opposite side. A simple U of cardboard forms the stand (with weights on it to keep it still, and small additional pieces of cardboard to keep the resting position consistent). The servo motor is mounted in a snugly fitting hole cut in the cardboard.\n\nA small piece of translucent plastic (from a nametag holder) makes a ramp so the die can roll over the LEDs/wire. Plastic wrap with a rubber-band provides a cover. This prevents the die from rolling out when the carton tips down for each roll.\n\nThe LEDs are placed through slots in the carton, facing downward. This keeps them from shining back up at the camera. One power supply wire is inside the carton, and one outside (soldered in place). With the LEDs on and the room lights off, there is negligable glare.\n\nA colored paper insert can fit in the bottom of the tub to provide contrast for white dice.\nThe camera is a Nikon D90, using a long (55-200mm) lens for low perspective distortion across the visual field. It is triggered via wired remote (though the GPS/remote port was defective and required repair); and powered via its AC adapter port (using a 3D-printed plug).\n", "url": "http://www.markfickett.com/stuff/artPage.php?id=389", "hostname": "www.markfickett.com", "category": "uncategorized", "item_id": 19256345, "item_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19256345", "root_id": null, "original_title": "How Fair Is My D20?
