In cases where the parties disagree on what the law is, a common law court looks to past precedential decisions of relevant courts, and synthesizes the principles of those past cases as applicable to the current facts.  If a similar dispute has been resolved in the past, the court is usually bound to follow the reasoning used in the prior decision (a principle known as stare decisis). If, however, the court finds that the current dispute is fundamentally distinct from all previous cases (called a \"matter of first impression\"), and legislative statutes are either silent or ambiguous on the question, judges have the authority and duty to resolve the issue (one party or the other has to win, and on disagreements of law, judges make that decision).[7] The court states an opinion that gives reasons for the decision, and those reasons agglomerate with past decisions as precedent to bind future judges and litigants. Common law, as the body of law made by judges,[3][8] stands in contrast to and on equal footing with statutes which are adopted through the legislative process, and regulations which are promulgated by the executive branch (the interactions among these different sources of law are explained later in this article).  Stare decisis, the principle that cases should be decided according to consistent principled rules so that similar facts will yield similar results, lies at the heart of all common law systems.[9]\n", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_law#Common_law_legal_systems_as_opposed_to_civil_law_legal_systems", "hostname": "en.wikipedia.org", "category": "wiki_article", "comment_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19213599"}, {"title": "Stop that!

In a U.S. historical context, the phrase 'Corporate Personhood' refers to the ongoing legal debate over the extent to which rights traditionally associated with natural persons should also be afforded to corporations. A headnote issued by the Court Reporter in the 1886 Supreme Court case Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad Co. claimed to state the sense of the Court regarding the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment as it applies to corporations, without the Court having actually made a decision or issued a written opinion on that point. This was the first time that the Supreme Court was reported to hold that the Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection clause granted constitutional protections to corporations as well as to natural persons, although numerous other cases, since Dartmouth College v. Woodward in 1819, had recognized that corporations were entitled to some of the protections of the Constitution. In Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. (2014), the Court found that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 exempted Hobby Lobby from aspects of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act because those aspects placed a substantial burden on the closely held company's owners' exercise of free religion.[2]\n", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_personhood", "hostname": "en.wikipedia.org", "category": "wiki_article", "comment_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19212031"}, {"title": "Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act - Wikipedia", "description": "The Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act of 1980 (FIRPTA), enacted as Subtitle C of Title XI (the \"Revenue Adjustments Act of 1980\") of the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1980, Pub.

We think bamboo is pretty amazing and is worthy of our appreciation. We also have other&nbsp;wood sunglasses Here are some cool things to know about the strength of bamboo.&nbsp;\r\n\t1. Bamboo Is Strong:&nbsp;\r\n\tWhen compared to wood, bamboo fiber is 2-3 times stronger than timber. &nbsp;Maple wood is one of the densest and strongest hardwoods, yet bamboo is stronger while still being quite a bit lighter.\r\n\tIn Hong Kong, bamboo's abundance, incredibly strong structure, and light weight combine to make it perfect to be used as \r\n\tscaffolding in the construction of skyscrapers. Check it out:&nbsp;\r\n\t&nbsp; &nbsp;\r\n\t\r\n\tHow It Works did a fantastic video that talks about bamboo scaffolding used in Hong Kong. See how it is used here:\r\n\t\r\n\t2. Bamboo's Strength Comes From Being Hard\r\n\tFortius Bamboo is 122% harder than Tasmanian Oak and out performs just about every wood in the market. It is no wonder that in addition to scaffolding, it is being used for flooring, walls, decking, plywood, fencing and more.&nbsp;\r\n\tThe scale below how bamboo and these other woods performed on the Janka hardness test that measures the resistance of wood to denting and wear. &nbsp;and 11.28 mm (.444 inch) steel ball into the wood to half of the ball's diameter. Turns out, it takes 3,000 pounds of force to achieve this with Fortius Bamboo.&nbsp;\r\n\t\r\n\t3. In Some Ways Bamboo Cable is Stronger Than Steel\r\n\tThe tensile strength of plaited bamboo cables is as strong as or stronger than a steel cable of the same size. Hemp rope loses 20% of its strength when wet while bamboo cables increase in strength by as much as 20% when wet. In fact, in South America,&nbsp;bamboo is referred to as vegetable steel.\r\n\tThe longest bamboo suspension bridge was built across the Min-chiang River in China, and was built over 1000 years ago. &nbsp;While it was damaged, ferry boats were used, then in 1803 the bridge was rebuilt. The bridge was 850 feet long, 9 feet wide and supported by 10 woven bamboo cables 6 inches in diameter. Pretty crazy a bamboo bridge could span nearly 900 feet!! &nbsp;Quite the feat. &nbsp;(In 1974 the bridge was replaced by a steel cable bridge.)\r\n\tHere is a video of a failure test of a connector for bamboo structures. It finally fails at 57.6 kN which translates to about 5.8 tons of force. That is roughly 13,000 pounds of force! The breaking point happens at 1:50 into the video.\r\nThis is just the tip of the iceberg for bamboo. We will continue to post about the awesomeness of bamboo, so be sure to check back later! So, buy some&nbsp;brown-stained bamboo sunglasses or some&nbsp;natural bamboo sunglasses here now!&nbsp;\r\n\tJanka Hardness Test", "url": "https://makawear.com/blog/things-you-didnt-know-about-bamboo-strength/", "hostname": "makawear.com", "category": "uncategorized", "comment_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19214992"}, {"title": "OnionShare 2 adds anonymous dropboxes, supports new Tor addresses, and is translated into a dozen new languages", "description": null, "url": "https://micahflee.com/2019/02/onionshare-2/", "hostname": "micahflee.com", "category": "uncategorized", "comment_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19212987"}, {"title": "Welcome to Stem! — Stem 1.7.1 documentation", "description": "\n\nHome\nTutorials\n\nHello World\nClient Usage\nEvent Listening\nHidden Services\nTor Descriptors\nUtilities\nInterpreter\nExamples\n\n\nAPI\n\nstem.control\nstem.connection\nstem.socket\nstem.process\nstem.response\nstem.exit_policy\nstem.version\nDescriptors\nUtilities\n\n\nDevelopment\n\nFAQ\nChange Log\nBug Tracker\nJenkins\nDownload\n\n\nContact\n\nEmail List\nIRC\nAuthor\n\n\n\n", "url": "https://stem.torproject.org", "hostname": "stem.torproject.org", "category": "site", "comment_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19213126"}, {"title": "cretz/bine", "description": "Go library for accessing and embedding Tor clients and servers - cretz/bine", "url": "https://github.com/cretz/bine", "hostname": "github.com", "category": "repository", "comment_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19213126"}, {"title": "Alt.Anonymous.Messages Newsgroup ", "description": "      For two people who want to communicate securely and keep their association secret there is the alt.anonymous.messages newsgroup.

Originally I tried to use some low-drag NACA\nducts but they didn't supply enough air so I added scoops, which improved things\nbut the engine is still starving for air.\n\nThe next step is some internal ducting to direct the incoming air towards the engine's\nintake.\n\nBut enjoy the video of progress to date:\n\n\n\nHow fast?\nHere's the latest video of my PJ8C-powered Long-EZ ARF flying.\n\nI swapped out the original first-prototype for the second prototype on which\nall production engines are based.  This is now one seriously-fast RC model.\n\nThere are many turbine-powered models costing thousands of dollars which can't\nkeep up with this low-cost jet-powered ARF and instead of using expensive,\nharder to get jet-fuel mixed expensive turbine oil, the PJ8C runs on regular\ngasoline from the pump at your local garage.\n\n\n\n\nOr you can watch it in high quality by clicking this link:\nVery fast PJ8C-powered Long-EZ ARF\n\nSee how the PJ8C is made\nQuite a few folks have asked to see how the PJ8C is made so I've created\na page with a few pictures and a brief description of how I build these engines.\nIf you're curious, check out the How the PJ8C is made page.\n\n\nHow do pulsejets work?\nAlthough I've written a lot about pulsejet engines, one of the questions I\nstill get asked most often is \"how do they work\".  To answer this I've\ncreated the following YouTube video.  I hope it will explain all.\n\n\n\nLimited number of new PJ8C ceramic-coated engines available\n\nI have a small quantity of the new redesigned\nPJ8C engines and other accessories for sale.\n\n\n\nThere's never been a cheaper way to get into jet-powered RC model flying.\n\nCeramic coating and pulsejets\nOne of the big problems with pulsejet engines is that they run very, very hot -- soemthing\nthat often limits their application and reduces their operation life.\n\nTo help reduce this problem, I'm now using a ceramic coating (which the manufacturer\nclaims is also used by NASA) on the inside of\nmy engines which protects the metal from exposure to hot combustion gases\nand also provides a measure of insulation -- effectively improving efficiency\nand reducing external operating temperatures.\n\nMore to follow on this...\n\n\nThe new PJ8 takes to the air (update)\nAn updated version of my PJ8 design has been test-flown in a cheap Chinese\nLong-EZ ARF. (and a special version for the BobCat 50 ARF should be ready\nin a week or two).\n\nThe fuel-bubble issues have been sorted now and I have been able to enjoy\nsome much longer flights with the PJ8/Long-EZ combination.\n\nAs you can see in the new video (below), the PJ8 is a good match for the Long-EZ\nairframe.  The reed valve that has now done quite a few flights and much static\nground-running (while fixing up the fuel system) finally expired on this flight -\nyou can year it starting to sound a bit odd near the end of the flight before\nI cut the engine.\n\n\n\nBecause the Long-EZ doesn't have a tail, it was very easy to modify for pulsejet\npower.\n\nMore video of the Long-EZ will be posted soon and the updated plans will be\nadded to my Pulsejet Book.\n\n\n\n\nAt last, ECU for pulsejets\n\nAn interesting project I've been working recently is an Engine Control Unit\nfor pulsejet engines.\n\n\n\nLots of folks have talked about using electronics to provide better control\nof pulsejet engines but, to the best of my knowledge, nobody has actually done\nso to date, or at least not until now.\n\nThe circuit you see in this picture is a rough and ready (but fully functional)\nprototype of my pulsejet ECU system.\n\nAlthough it looks a bit like a bird's-nest of wires and components, this ECU\ndoes some very clever stuff.  For example, it actually listens to each combustion\ncycle using a transducer.  That information (along with other data such\nas temperature, mass-flow and thrust) is constantly monitored and used to\nfine-tune the engine's operation and ensure maximum performance is achieved\nat all points on the power-curve.\n\nThe ECU also supports fully automated start/restart and shutdown for engines using gas\nand/or liquid fuel.\n\nRight now I'm designing the final circuit board which will see all that mess\ncondensed down to a unit about the size of a credit-card.\n\nStay tuned for more information and some video of the ECU in action.\n\nI'm back!\nAfter a long time away from my pulsejet projects I'm back!\n\n\n\nThis site will be getting a major facelift pretty soon and I'll be showing you\nsome of the cool stuff I've been working on in the pulsejet area.\n\n\nI'm currently preparing a new XJet prototype that will be shipped off to a university\nfor testing and validation of the performance, this being the final step before\ncommercial production.\n\nAnd I've also been very busy writing my book which is chock-full of stuff\nthat any tech-head will find both entertaining and interesting.\n\nIf you missed it, I see that the epsiode of ScrapHeap Challenge in which I\nappeared as an \"expert\" and directed a team of Navy engineers in their\ntask of building and racing a pulse-jet powered vehicle has been uploaded\nto YouTube.  Links to these videos are on my\nScrapheap Challenge page.\n\nThe biggest, meanest pulsejet dragster ever!\nUPDATE: we've had our first short runs in the dragster and it is, in a word,\n\"frightening\"!\n\nAnd here, as promised, are a few pictures of the tentative first few runs.\n\n\n\n\nThe power to weight ratio is extremely good, producing some really astounding\nacceleration, and the noise is astonishing -- especially when the engines\nlose synchronization and a beat-frequency can clearly be heard modulating\nthe level of sound and vibration.\n\nOne thing that immediately became apparent however, is that if the engines do\nlose synchronization, there's a definite tendency for the exhaust of one to be\ningested by the other, resulting in a premature flame-out.\n\nThis problem will be significantly reduced when the augmentors are added but\nin the meantime, a simple dividing plate between the two intake pipes seems\nto have dramatically reduced the magnitude of the problem -- albeit while\nmaking the engines less likely to sync-up in the first place.\n\n\n\nIt's been quite a while since I updated this website but I've been very busy\nin the workshop.  Here's a picture of what I've currently got under construction:\n\n\n\n\nThis monster is powered by two enhanced Lockwood valveless pulsejets which\nhave been tested to produce 150lbs of thrust each in an unaugmented configuration\nwhen run on propane.\n\nEarly tests on Jet A1 indicate that this thrust can be lifted to around 180lbs\neach and, with the addition of an augmentor, a figure of around 220lbs of static\nthrust per engine should be possible -- for a total of 440lbs.\n\nThe entire vehicle currently weighs in at under 180lbs so I'm expecting some\npretty impressive acceleration and speed.\n\nI'll be posting more pictures in the next week or so.\n\nNote that this engine design has been licensed to a New Zealand company\n(SimpleJets) who have\nalready started manufacturing.\n\nPulsejet CD download option\nThe entire contents of The Enthusiast's Guide to Pulsejet Engines will\nsoon be available for download by those who wish to purchase (or have\nalready purchased) it.  This means you'll get faster access to all that\ninteresting information and a wealth of detailed information on the\nhistory, design and construction of real pulsejet engines.\n\nNew No-weld pulsejet engine design\n\nIt's already on the CD, complete with a VCD-quality video, and soon I'll be\nuploading a set of somewhat more\nbasic instructions which means anyone can build this\npulsejet in their own garage with just a few hand-tools.\n\nNow there's no excuse for not building your own engine!\n\nPulsejet Book on CD Revised\nIf you've already got my book on CD, you will shortly be receiving\nanother disk containing a freshly revised edition with even more information\nand plans.  More information can be found here.\n\nTV Crews All Over The Place\n\nOver the past six weeks or so I've had TV crews here on a fairly regular basis.\nThey've been filming a couple of items on me and my jet engine activities. Unfortunately,\nthis footage is unlikely to be seen outside of New Zealand but we did some really\ncool night-runs with the JetKart that looked very impressive.\n\nThis shot in particular shows how a vortex forms in the exhaust of the pulsejet\nduring the exhaust phase.\n\nI'll post some more pictures from these night-shoots in a week or so when I've\nhad a chance to dump it onto my computer.\n\n\n\nKids, do not try this at home -- I am just crazy\n\n\nThe Pulsejet Book Is Finished!\nAt long last I have finished the final edition of what is perhaps\nYes, at long last, and thanks to the feedback from many readers of the\ndraft edition, the final version of \"The Enthusiast's Guide to Pulsejet Engines\"\nis completed and available on CD.  The printed edition will be available\nas a seperate item for those who prefer ink stains\non dead trees.

Here's a very short\nvideo clip\n(1.1MB MPEG) that shows how it can be started simply by turning on the fuel.  You can\nalso see how much power this engine has by the way it flattens the grass in\nfront of it.\n\nNote that the full plans and extra constructional information for this engine\nare included in the final draft of my pulsejet book. (see below)\n\n\nHow Fast Does The Jet Kart Go?\nUp until now I've just been guessing at the top speed of my jet-kart\nbut seat-of-the-pants estimates can be rather unreliable so I fitted\na GPS and took it out to a nice, long, straight piece of tarmac.\n\nHow fast did it go?

It is simple enough that it could be fitted to almost any existing\npetal-valved pulsejet, including engines such as the Dynajet, Tiger Jet\nand others.\n\nFeel free to use this design in your own engines, all I ask is a little\nattribution where relevant.\n\n\nThis Site Is Looking For Sponsorship\nIf you're interested in perhaps sponsoring\nthis site then click here.\n\n23 June: You just have to see the latest Jet Kart picture I found!\n\nThe X-Jet To Go GPL?\nShould I place the X-Jet and all the R&D work done on it to date into the public domain?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Visitors since 6 April 2002\n\n\n\nThe Low Cost Cruise Missile\nWant to build your own cruise missile?

-- check out the pictures and video\nof my Gas Turbine Engine which I ran for the first\ntime on 9 April 2000.\n\nSome Background\nWhen I first started tinkering with pulsejet engine technology in 1999,\nI realized that there was huge potential for improving these devices.\n\nAlthough deceptively simple in construction, their design had changed\nlittle in the 55 years since the end of WW2, when they were rapidly\nreplaced by the now common turbojet.\n\nThe opportunity to apply 21st century materials and knowledge to the\ntask of improving a design still mired in the 1950's was too great\nto resist -- so I set about developing a range of engines, each\nincremental better than the last.\n\nIn early 2001 I took the results of over a year's experimentation\nand designed the radically new X-Jet engine which\nnow surpasses traditional pulsejet engines in terms of performance,\nefficiency and reliability by a huge amount.\n\nThe improvements are, in fact, so significant that they have once again\nmade the pulsejet a definite contender for specific low-end applications\nsuch as recreational vehicles (including microlight and homebuilt aircraft),\nmilitary drones, etc.\n\nThanks to the X-Jet design, it is now possible to sell a reliable\njet engine producing over 55Kgs (150lbs) of thrust and weighing under\n6.5KG (15 lbs) for less than US$1,000, more than 20 times cheaper\nthan the equivalent turbojet.\n\nAs a result of the information published on this website, I have already\nreceived a significant level of interest from people wanting to buy\none (or in some cases more) engines based on the X-Jet design, however\nmy resources are limited and at this stage I will continue to work\non further improving and refining the design rather than diverting my\nattentions to manufacturing activities.\n\nThis development is continuing thanks in part to a technology grant\nfrom the New Zealand government -- but additional investment capital will\nbe required to commercialize the engine for licensing and manufacture to\na global market.\n\nInquiries are welcomed from investors who may wish to participate in\ncommercializing this design and companies which may wish to manufacture\nthe engine in various sizes under license.", "url": "http://www.aardvark.co.nz/pjet/", "hostname": "www.aardvark.co.nz", "category": "uncategorized", "comment_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19211167"}, {"title": "RCModelReviews", "description": "This is the YouTube channel of http://www.RCModelReviews.com RC Model Reviews brings you totally objective, unbiased in-depth reviews of RC products that are...", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/user/RCModelReviews", "hostname": "www.youtube.com", "category": "uncategorized", "comment_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19212140"}, {"title": "How former ref Tim Donaghy conspired to fix NBA games", "description": "In 2007, NBA ref Tim Donaghy pleaded guilty to betting on games he officiated.

The Arlington Resort Hotel & Spa is a nearly 500 room resort in the Ouachita Mountains of Hot Springs National Park, Arkansas, home of Oaklawn Race Track and the Arkansas Derby.  The resort has accommodations for single occupancy or groups between 20 and 2000. Mineral baths are available in the Spa between the third and fourth floor, which make use of the natural hot springs. Massages and hot stone treatments are also available in the Spa. The hotel contains three restaurants, an open bar in the main lobby, a full service beauty salon, a gift shop, a ladies shopping boutique, and live entertainment on weekends. Guests enjoy golf and tennis privileges at the Hot Springs Country Club, approximately 2.7 miles to the south east.  The hotel is located at the north end of \"Bathhouse Row\". As of 2009, the Arlington is a three star hotel.  Samuel W. Fordyce and two other entrepreneurs financed the construction of the first luxury hotel in the area, the first Arlington Hotel which opened in 1875. When it was rebuilt in 1892-93, it was known as the New Arlington, and boasted of its Spanish Renaissance architecture. With 300 rooms in four stories of red brick, it had corner towers. This second Arlington burned to the ground on April 5, 1923. Those buildings were at the north end of Bathhouse Row, where the Arlington Park then was created. The third Arlington Hotel, designed by Mann and Stern in 1925, is the current hotel at the \"Y\" intersection at the corner of Central Avenue and Fountain Street. The building's huge size, Spanish-Colonial Revival style, and placement at the terminus of the town's most important vista made the building a key Hot Springs landmark. The original site became a park at the north end of Bathhouse Row.  In the 1930s, the Arlington Hotel was a favorite vacation spot for Al Capone.  en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlington_Hotel_(Hot_Springs_Nation...  View from Scenic Mountain Drive up Hot Springs Mountain in Hot Springs National Park, Hot Springs, Arkansas.  Hot Springs is the 10th most populous city in the U.S. state of Arkansas, the county seat of Garland County, and the principal city of the Hot Springs Metropolitan Statistical Area encompassing all of Garland County. According to 2008 Census Bureau estimates, the population of the city was 39,467.  Hot Springs is traditionally best known for the natural spring water that gives it its name, flowing out of the ground at a temperature of 147 degrees Fahrenheit (64 degrees C). Hot Springs National Park is the oldest federal reserve in the USA, and the tourist trade brought by the famous springs make it a very successful spa town.  The city takes its name from the natural thermal water that flows from 47 springs on the western slope of Hot Springs Mountain in the historic downtown district of the city. About a million gallons of 143-degree water flow from the springs each day. The rate of flow is not affected by fluctuations in the rainfall in the area. Studies by National Park Service scientists have determined through carbon dating that the water that reaches the surface in Hot Springs fell as rainfall in an as-yet undetermined watershed 4,000 years earlier. The water percolates very slowly down through the earth’s surface until it reaches superheated areas deep in the crust and then rushes rapidly to the surface to emerge from the 47 hot springs.  A small channel of hot spring water known as Hot Springs Creek runs under ground from an area near Park Avenue to Bath House Row.  en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_Springs,_Arkansas  en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_...

We evaluated this hypothesis by passing digital images of zebras through species-specific spatial and colour filters to simulate their appearance for the visual systems of zebras’ primary predators and zebras themselves. We also measured stripe widths and luminance contrast to estimate the maximum distances from which lions, spotted hyaenas, and zebras can resolve stripes. We found that beyond ca. 50 m (daylight) and 30 m (twilight) zebra stripes are difficult for the estimated visual systems of large carnivores to resolve, but not humans. On moonless nights, stripes are difficult for all species to resolve beyond ca. 9 m. In open treeless habitats where zebras spend most time, zebras are as clearly identified by the lion visual system as are similar-sized ungulates, suggesting that stripes cannot confer crypsis by disrupting the zebra’s outline. Stripes confer a minor advantage over solid pelage in masking body shape in woodlands, but the effect is stronger for humans than for predators. Zebras appear to be less able than humans to resolve stripes although they are better than their chief predators. In conclusion, compared to the uniform pelage of other sympatric herbivores it appears highly unlikely that stripes are a form of anti-predator camouflage.", "url": "https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0145679", "hostname": "journals.plos.org", "category": "uncategorized", "comment_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19213550"}], "categories": ["site", "repository", "wiki_article", "amazon_item", "video", "tweet", "subreddit", "reddit_post", "news", "uncategorized"]}
