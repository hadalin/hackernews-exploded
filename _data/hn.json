While it's not finished, we're up to nearly 800 patches, and\nso maintaining it out-of-tree is becoming a bit unruly...and it's in\nsolid enough shape that it could benefit from being in-tree.\n\nI've opened a merge request here:\nhttps://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/merge_requests/283\n\nFor now, Iris will build and install alongside i965 - with i965\nremaining the default driver.  Iris is still considered experimental.\n\nMore details below...\n\n--Ken\n\nWhat is Iris?\n-------------\n\nThe new \"Iris\" driver prototype is essentially our Mesa i965 driver\nreimagined and rebuilt from the ground up.  Our main goal was to make\nthe driver as efficient as possible, aiming for very low CPU overhead.\nWe also decided to drop support for legacy hardware and outdated kernel\ndrivers, freeing us up to design for the future without worrying about\nimpacting the past.  This let us ask, \"if we were doing it all\nagain...what would we want it to look like?\"\n\nWhile designing the new driver, we drew a lot of inspiration from our\nnewer Vulkan driver, as well as a few other Gallium drivers.\n\nKey Changes\n-----------\n\n* All new state upload code is dramatically more efficient.\n\n  In CPU overhead microbenchmarks, Iris can issue on average\n  3 times as many draw calls per second as our i965 driver.\n\n* Supports only Broadwell and newer (Gen8+); drops support for\n  the older Gen4-7.5 GPUs, as well as Braswell/Cherrytrail.\n\n* Updated memory management takes full advantage of modern PPGTT\n  support, allocating VMA in userspace for greater control, and\n  allowing us to pre-bake state containing addresses.\n\n* Requires a modern Linux kernel (v4.16+, could be v4.5 if needed).\n\n* Leverages Mesa's \"Gallium\" driver framework, allowing us to share\n  more code and development effort with the rest of the community.\n\nWhile many pieces are new, much of the driver remains the same.\nWe continue using these components of our existing stack:\n\n* The Mesa OpenGL API front-end\n* The Mesa shader compiler (GLSL, SPIR-V, NIR, i965 Gen-assembly backend)\n* The Intel Surface Layout (ISL) library\n* The Intel Blit-on-Render-Pipe (BLORP) library\n* The i965 auxiliary surface resolve tracker\n* The i965 buffer manager (extended, but largely reused)\n\nQ&A\n---\n\nQ: How do I build and use Iris?\n\nIris only supports the Meson and Android build systems (sorry, no\nAutotools or SCons support).  To build Iris, use -Dgallium-drivers=iris\nwhen running Meson.  -Ddri-drivers=i965 will also build i965.\n\ni965 remains the default driver (assuming it's built).  You can try\nout Iris on a per-application basis by setting an environment variable:\n\n   $ export MESA_LOADER_DRIVER_OVERRIDE=iris\n\nPlease note that Iris requires a modern kernel, such as 4.19+.\n\nQ: Should I use Iris yet?\n\nIris is not considered stable or ready for production use - it's still\nvery experimental.  However, it is largely feature complete (a few less\ncommonly-used features are missing), and is passing roughly 99% of the\nPiglit test suite and OpenGL CTS.  We have not done extensive testing\nor benchmarking of games and applications yet.\n\nIf you're feeling adventurous, feel free to try it out and report\nissues at https://bugs.freedesktop.org/ under product Mesa and the\nDrivers/Gallium/Iris component.  Or ask us on IRC (irc.freenode.net\nchannel #intel-3d).\n\nQ: Are there any known issues?\n\n* Currently, Glamor rendering, and shaders using gl_VertexID, may not\n  work correctly.  This will be fixed shortly after merging.\n\n* GPU reset support is poor - if it hangs, it will likely hang\n  repeatedly until the kernel bans it.  Chris Wilson and I are\n  working on a solution for this.\n\n* There is a known kernel memory leak in some 4.18 kernels, which\n  Iris can provoke.  The fix has already been backported, but a few\n  distros didn't pick it up before moving on to 4.19+.  Please use\n  the latest available kernel.\n\n* Performance is expected to be slower than i965 for the moment, in\n  many cases, but this will improve in the days to come.  There are\n  still a number of stall avoidance paths which have not been hooked\n  up yet, which can lead to the GPU idling.  Fast clears support is\n  missing, and end-to-end color compression is not working yet.\n\n  We expect it to be faster in the long run, and it already is in\n  some particular cases.  For one customer, Iris is 18% faster than\n  i965.  Your mileage may vary until the driver matures a bit more.\n\nQ: What's with the commit history?\n\nThe commit history in this merge request is largely the actual\nnon-idealized history for bringing up the driver, rather than the\ntidy patch series we're used to seeing.  I decided that preserving\nthe history mostly as-is might be of interest to other people who\nare considering bringing up a new driver, to see how I did it.\nAlso, after a year of work, I wanted to be able to fairly attribute\npeople's work, and squashing it would not have done that justice.\n\nDuring development, I rebased the driver on master periodically.\nAt the end, I went back and ensured that the driver would at least\ncompile at each step, so that people can bisect across it without\nas many issues.  I also squashed some obvious fixup commits.  But\nit's largely still the original history.\n\nQ: Who developed Iris?\n\nAccording to git shortlog, the following people contributed patches\nto Iris which made it into the original MR:\n\n    Kenneth Graunke (732)\n    Jordan Justen (14)\n    Dave Airlie (13)\n    Chris Wilson (12)\n    Rafael Antognolli (8)\n    Jason Ekstrand (7)\n    Caio Marcelo de Oliveira Filho (3)\n    Andre Heider (2)\n    Rhys Kidd (1)\n    Sagar Ghuge (1)\n    Tapani PÃ¤lli (1)\n    Timur KristÃ³f (1)\n\nThis understates the work, however, as we've reused a lot of code\nfrom our existing drivers and infrastructure, so my thanks to the\nwhole Intel Mesa team, and the entire Mesa community.  Particular\nthanks to Dave Airlie, Ilia Mirkin, Marek OlÅ¡Ã¡k, and Eric Anholt,\nand others for answering a lot of questions about Gallium.\n\nIn any list of acknowledgments, I am sure to have missed people;\nsorry for the omission, and thank you nonetheless!\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: signature.asc\nType: application/pgp-signature\nSize: 833 bytes\nDesc: This is a digitally signed message part.\nURL: <https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/mesa-dev/attachments/20190220/51f78fed/attachment-0001.sig>\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious message (by thread): [Mesa-dev] [Bug 109532] ir_variable has maximum access out of bounds -- but it's not out of bounds\n\nNext message (by thread): [Mesa-dev] [Bug 109698] dri.pc contents invalid when built with meson\n\n Messages sorted by:\n[ date ]\n[ thread ]\n[ subject ]\n[ author ]\n\n\n\nMore information about the mesa-dev\nmailing list\n", "url": "https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/mesa-dev/2019-February/215576.html", "hostname": "lists.freedesktop.org", "category": "uncategorized", "comment_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19233045"}, {"title": "The Impossible Mathematics of the Real World - Issue 69: Patterns - Nautilus", "description": "Using stiff paper and transparent tape, Craig Kaplan assembles a beautiful roundish shape that looks like a Buckminster Fuller creation&#8230;", "url": "http://nautil.us/issue/69/patterns/the-impossible-mathematics-of-the-real-world-rp", "hostname": "nautil.us", "category": "uncategorized", "comment_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19232343"}, {"title": "A new near miss", "description": "The photo above is a paper model of a polyhedron that I just assembled.
