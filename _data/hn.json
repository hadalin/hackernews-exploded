(Christopher Galpin in 2014 links to a number of other interesting analyses; John Kern in 2006 does Bayesian analysis for Pass the Pigs.) They rolled and tallied by hand.\nSkip to:\n\nHardware: Die Rolling Machine\nSoftware: Computer Vision\nLicense: cc-nc-4.0\nComments\n\nSee the Github repository for the scripts used to process image data from test runs, and data for each die tested. The source data for these charts is shared on Google Drive, including full image data for one die.\nResults\nOverview\n\nSmaller standard deviation is better, and expected values closer to 10½ are better (meaning \"fairer\" in both cases).\nExpected value is the average roll; for an ideal, fair d20 this is 10½, so the graph shows most of the tested d20s are slightly unlucky. However this graph doesn't tell you about specific roll outcomes (like 20s or 1s).\nThe standard deviation is on the normalized frequencies of the rolls for a die; thus a d20 where all sides have ideal (1.0) frequency has a standard deviation of 0.0, whereas dice with more variation have higher standard deviations.\n\nTrends within brands are discussed below, but it appears that across brands d20s (with most showing a standard deviation above 0.10) are less fair than dice with fewer sides.\nHow Many Rolls?\n100-150 rolls per die face.\nThe below data is from an opaque purple Wiz Dice d20, rolled 8000 times.\n\nThe different datasets are from random subsamples of the actual rolled sequence. So the blue series labeled \"100\" is from taking 100 random rolls from the set of 8000, and charting the relative normalized frequency of each side within that subsample; similarly for the other sample counts.\n\"Normalized Frequency\" is used so Y values on different histograms / for different dice can be compared easily. For example, an ideal fair d20 rolled 3000 times would show each face 150 times. So if a 20 actually comes up 102 times, the normalized frequency is 0.68. That is, in the example 20s showed up 68% of the times you would expect from a fair die. And frequencies of 1.0 correspond to what would be expected of a fair die.\nThe relative side frequencies for 1000 rolls or (especially) 100 rolls are fairly different from the frequencies at 8000 rolls. But anything from 2000 up looks fairly close. Thus I conclude that 2000 rolls is probably sufficient, and for good measure 3000 rolls should give a good picture of the die's behavior; this implies 100-150 rolls per side.\nFor a Crystal Caste clear black d8, rolled 3000 times:\n\nIn this case, with 512 samples the frequencies look somewhat different from those at 3000 samples, but with 1024 it's fairly close.\nThis leads me to a heuristic of 100 rolls per side (800 for a d8, 2000 for a d20). It is of course a subjective heuristic.\nChessex\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Chessex dice I tested: I bought a 7-die Copper-Steel Gemini set and a bag of 6 d20s (from which I tested a red, yellow and purple/gray die), and borrowed another d20 (green, probably 1990s purchase date).\n\nThe Chessex d20s are all mid-range fairness. The older borrowed green die (probably 1990s) proving fairer. (The rest were all purchased in 2015.) They seem to roughly favor and avoid the same numbers which, on the dice, are arranged like the two sewn halves of a baseball.\nOn these dice (as with most d20s), physically opposite faces sum to 21 (1 and 20, 2 and 19, etc). The distribution of frequencies is fairly symmetric around 10½, possibly as a result, which prevents the expected value of the die from deviating too far from 10½.\nWiz Dice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Wiz dice I tested: Dice from two sets out of a highcitybooks.com 35-die set; and three borrowed dice. (Note that highcitybooks is as of 2015 November selling Chessex, but historically sells bulk dice from multiple brands.)\n\n\n\n\n\nThese Wiz Dice were highly variable, but do tend to have symmetrical distributions around 10½ (like Chessex). In this small sample, the translucent dice were less fair than the opaques.\nGame Science\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Game Science dice I tested: two individual d20s; one black with gold numerals, and one white with black. (Just for fun, I've put the white one on eBay.) I tested the black d20 both before and after trimming a molding bump (left and right images above, respectively; the trimmed bump is at the right of the edge between 7 and 4). Game Science promotes its dice as especially fair.\n\nThe dice require trimming after they arrive. The two dice did both arrive with visible bumps. I tested the black die before and after trimming it, and saw a significant improvement in fairness, in fact leaving the black Game Science d20 as the fairest d20 tested (with a standard deviation of 0.07, up from 0.12, and a Chi Squared value of 0.76). But the black die's expected value was 10.38 before trimming and 10.37 afterwards (compared to 10.5 for an ideal fair d20). However the white d20 after trimming was only run-of-the-mill (standard deviation of 0.12).\nUnlike other dice tested (including the white d20), the black d20 very quickly became marred (possibly from hitting the LEDs mounted inside the rolling machine).\nThe white d20's expected value of 10.67 makes it one of the luckiest dice tested.\nCrystal Caste\n\n\n\n\nThe Crystal Caste dice I tested: hybrid translucent orange and black/white translucent.\n\nCrystal Caste's d20s were by far the least fair tested. The orange d20 (above) was visibly egg-shaped: longest diameter 19.77mm between 4 and 17, shortest diameter 18.98mm between 1 and 20. The two d20s do follow a similar distribution, and both have slightly low expected values, 10.18 and 10.24.\n\n\n\n\nI also compared one \"Crystal\" die to its platonic solid counterpart.\n\nCrystal Caste says the \"Cyrstal Dice\" are \"A totally new shape for RPG polyhedral dice: geometric cyrstals with sides of exactly the same size, guaranteeing random numbers.\" However their \"crystal\" d6 compared very poorly to their own cube d6 from another set (standard deviations of 0.25 and 0.05 respectively). (Their standard-shaped d8 also performed fairly well with a standard deviation of 0.09.)\nKoplow\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Koplow dice I tested: three dice from a set of 10 d20s.\n\nUnlike the other d20s, the opposing sides on Koplow d20s do not all sum to 21. The pairs are: 1/20 2/12 3/17 4/16 5/19 6/14 7/13 8/18 9/15 10/11.\nGeometric Analysis\nFollowing the example of 1000d4.com, I measured the distances between opposite sides of several d20s using digital calipers. Below is a comparison of those measurements and observed rolls.\n\nThe Crystal Caste (above) and Koplow (below) d20s clearly have some correlation between diameters and observed frequencies.\nAs an example, take sides 7 and 14, which are opposite each other on the Crystal Caste translucent orange d20 (graph above). The mean diameter of the die (the average distance from the center of one face to the center of its opposite face) is 19.43mm. The distance between 7 and 14 is 19.20mm, 0.23mm shorter than average (rendered as positive on the graph for easy comparison with roll frequencies). And in this case the compressed dimension correlates with both of those sides coming up more often than average (1.39 and 1.13 respectively).\n\n\nThe Wiz Dice (above) and Game Science (below) d20s have some correlation between diameters and frequencies, but (especially for the fairer Game Science die) not to the extent that diameters are a reliable predictor of observed rolls.\n\nHardware Setup (Die Roller and Camera)\n\nA microcontroller runs a servo motor to shake a small tub, and triggers a camera to take pictures. More details: Arduino sketch and hardware parts list.\n\nConstruction\nThe main container is an empty (and well washed) ice cream carton, chosen for its flat bottom and sloping sides. The servo motor's arm is taped to the side, and a paperclip makes the pivot on the opposite side. A simple U of cardboard forms the stand (with weights on it to keep it still, and small additional pieces of cardboard to keep the resting position consistent). The servo motor is mounted in a snugly fitting hole cut in the cardboard.\n\nA small piece of translucent plastic (from a nametag holder) makes a ramp so the die can roll over the LEDs/wire. Plastic wrap with a rubber-band provides a cover. This prevents the die from rolling out when the carton tips down for each roll.\n\nThe LEDs are placed through slots in the carton, facing downward. This keeps them from shining back up at the camera. One power supply wire is inside the carton, and one outside (soldered in place). With the LEDs on and the room lights off, there is negligable glare.\n\nA colored paper insert can fit in the bottom of the tub to provide contrast for white dice.\nThe camera is a Nikon D90, using a long (55-200mm) lens for low perspective distortion across the visual field. It is triggered via wired remote (though the GPS/remote port was defective and required repair); and powered via its AC adapter port (using a 3D-printed plug).\n", "url": "http://www.markfickett.com/stuff/artPage.php?id=389", "hostname": "www.markfickett.com", "category": "uncategorized", "item_id": 19256345, "item_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19256345", "root_id": null, "original_title": "How Fair Is My D20?

I do not know its name, so I will\ncall it the Tao of Programming.\n\nIf the Tao is great, then the operating system is great.\n\nIf the operating system is great, then the compiler is great.\n\nIf the compiler is great, then the application is great.\n\nThe user is pleased, and there is harmony in the world.\n\nThe Tao of Programming flows far away and returns on the wind of\nmorning.\n\n1.2\n \nThe Tao gave birth to machine language.  Machine language gave birth\nto the assembler.\n\nThe assembler gave birth to the compiler.  Now there are ten thousand\nlanguages.\n\nEach language has its purpose, however humble.  Each language\nexpresses the Yin and Yang of software.  Each language has its place\nwithin the Tao.\n\nBut do not program in COBOL if you can avoid it.\n\n1.3\n\nIn the beginning was the Tao.  The Tao gave birth to Space and Time.\n\nTherefore Space and Time are the Yin and Yang of programming.\n\nProgrammers that do not comprehend the Tao are always running out of\ntime and space for their programs.  Programmers that comprehend the\nTao always have enough time and space to accomplish their goals.\n\nHow could it be otherwise?\n\n1.4\n\nThe wise programmer is told about Tao and follows it.  The average\nprogrammer is told about Tao and searches for it.  The foolish\nprogrammer is told about Tao and laughs at it.\n\nIf it were not for laughter, there would be no Tao.\n\nThe highest sounds are hardest to hear.  Going forward is a way to\nretreat.  Great talent shows itself late in life.  Even a perfect\nprogram still has bugs.\n\nBOOK 2\nThe Ancient Masters\nThus spake the Master Programmer:\n \"After three days without programming, life\nbecomes meaningless.\"\n\n2.1\n\nThe programmers of old were mysterious and profound.  We cannot fathom\ntheir thoughts, so all we do is describe their appearance.\n\nAware, like a fox crossing the water.\n\nAlert, like a general on the battlefield.  \n\nKind, like a hostess greeting her guests.  \n\nSimple, like uncarved blocks of wood.  \n\nOpaque, like black pools in darkened caves.\n\nWho can tell the secrets of their hearts and minds?\n\nThe answer exists only in Tao.\n\n2.2\n\nThe Grand Master Turing once dreamed that he was a machine.  When he\nawoke, he exclaimed:\n\n\"I don't know whether I am Turing dreaming that I am a machine, or a\nmachine dreaming that I am Turing!\"\n\n2.3\n\nA programmer from a very large computer company went to a software\nconference and then returned to report to his manager, saying: \"What\nsort of programmers work for other companies?  They behaved badly and\nwere unconcerned with appearances.  Their hair was long and unkempt\nand their clothes were wrinkled and old.  They crashed our hospitality\nsuite and they made rude noises during my presentation.\"\n\nThe manager said: \"I should have never sent you to the conference.\nThose programmers live beyond the physical world.  They consider life\nabsurd, an accidental coincidence.  They come and go without knowing\nlimitations.  Without a care, they live only for their programs.  Why\nshould they bother with social conventions?\n\nThey are alive within the Tao.\"\n\n2.4\n\nA novice asked the Master: \"Here is a programmer that never designs,\ndocuments or tests his programs.  Yet all who know him consider him\none of the best programmers in the world.  Why is this?\"\n\nThe Master replied: \"That programmer has mastered the Tao.  He has\ngone beyond the need for design; he does not become angry when the\nsystem crashes, but accepts the universe without concern.  He has gone\nbeyond the need for documentation; he no longer cares if anyone else\nsees his code.  He has gone beyond the need for testing; each of his\nprograms are perfect within themselves, serene and elegant, their\npurpose self-evident.  Truly, he has entered the mystery of Tao.\"\n\nBOOK 3\nDesign\nThus spake the Master Programmer:\n \"When a program is being tested, it is too late\nto make design changes.\"\n\n3.1\n\nThere once was a man who went to a computer trade show.  Each day as\nhe entered, the man told the guard at the door:\n\n\"I am a great thief, renowned for my feats of shoplifting.  Be\nforewarned, for this trade show shall not escape unplundered.\"\n\nThis speech disturbed the guard greatly, because there were millions\nof dollars of computer equipment inside, so he watched the man\ncarefully.  But the man merely wandered from booth to booth, humming\nquietly to himself.\n\nWhen the man left, the guard took him aside and searched his clothes,\nbut nothing was to be found.\n\nOn the next day of the trade show, the man returned and chided the\nguard, saying: \"I escaped with a vast booty yesterday, but today will\nbe even better.\"  So the guard watched him ever more closely, but to\nno avail.\n\nOn the final day of the trade show, the guard could restrain his\ncuriosity no longer.  \"Sir Thief,\" he said, \"I am so perplexed, I\ncannot live in peace.  Please enlighten me.  What is it that you are\nstealing?\"\n\nThe man smiled.  \"I am stealing ideas,\" he said.\n\n3.2\n\nThere once was a Master Programmer who wrote unstructured programs.  A\nnovice programmer, seeking to imitate him, also began to write\nunstructured programs.  When the novice asked the Master to evaluate\nhis progress, the Master criticized him for writing unstructured\nprograms, saying, \"What is appropriate for the Master is not\nappropriate for the novice.  You must understand Tao before\ntranscending structure.\"\n\n3.3\n\nThere was once a programmer who was attached to the court of the\nwarlord of Wu.  The warlord asked the programmer: \"Which is easier to\ndesign: an accounting package or an operating system?\"\n\n\"An operating system,\" replied the programmer.\n\nThe warlord uttered an exclamation of disbelief.  \"Surely an\naccounting package is trivial next to the complexity of an operating\nsystem,\" he said.\n\n\"Not so,\" said the programmer, \"When designing an accounting package,\nthe programmer operates as a mediator between people having different\nideas: how it must operate, how its reports must appear, and how it\nmust conform to the tax laws.  By contrast, an operating system is not\nlimited by outside appearances.  When designing an operating system,\nthe programmer seeks the simplest harmony between machine and ideas.\nThis is why an operating system is easier to design.\"\n\nThe warlord of Wu nodded and smiled.  \"That is all good and well, but\nwhich is easier to debug?\"\n\nThe programmer made no reply.\n\n3.4\n\nA manager went to the Master Programmer and showed him the\nrequirements document for a new application.  The manager asked the\nMaster: \"How long will it take to design this system if I assign five\nprogrammers to it?\"\n\n\"It will take one year,\" said the Master promptly.\n\n\"But we need this system immediately or even sooner!  How long will it\ntake if I assign ten programmers to it?\"\n\nThe Master Programmer frowned.  \"In that case, it will take two\nyears.\"\n\n\"And what if I assign a hundred programmers to it?\"\n\nThe Master Programmer shrugged.  \"Then the design will never be\ncompleted,\" he said.\n\nBOOK 4\nCoding\nThus spake the Master Programmer:\n \"A well-written program is its own Heaven; a\npoorly-written program is its own Hell.\"\n\n4.1\n\nA program should be light and agile, its subroutines connected like a\nstring of pearls.  The spirit and intent of the program should be\nretained throughout.  There should be neither too little nor too much.\nNeither needless loops nor useless variables; neither lack of\nstructure nor overwhelming rigidity.\n\nA program should follow the \"Law of Least Astonishment\".  What is this\nlaw?  It is simply that the program should always respond to the users\nin the way that least astonishes them.\n\nA program, no matter how complex, should act as a single unit.  The\nprogram should be directed by the logic within rather than by outward\nappearances.\n\nIf the program fails in these requirements, it will be in a state of\ndisorder and confusion.  The only way to correct this is to rewrite\nthe program.\n\n4.2\n\nA novice asked the Master: \"I have a program that sometimes runs and\nsometimes aborts.  I have followed the rules of programming, yet I am\ntotally baffled.  What is the reason for this?\"\n\nThe Master replied: \"You are confused because you do not understand\nTao.  Only a fool expects rational behavior from his fellow humans.\nWhy do you expect it from a machine that humans have constructed?\nComputers simulate determinism; only Tao is perfect.\n\nThe rules of programming are transitory; only Tao is eternal.\nTherefore, you must contemplate Tao before you receive Enlightenment.\"\n\n\"But how will I know when I have received Enlightenment?\"  asked the\nnovice.\n\n\"Your program will run correctly,\" replied the Master.\n\n4.3\n\nThe Master was explaining the nature of Tao to one of his novices.\n\n\"The Tao is embodied in all software -- regardless of how\ninsignificant,\" said the Master.\n\n\"Is the Tao in a hand-held calculator?\" asked the novice.\n\n\"It is,\" came the reply.\n\n\"Is the Tao in a video game?\" asked the novice.\n\n\"It is even in a video game,\" said the Master.\n\n\"Is the Tao in the DOS for a personal computer?\" asked the novice.\n\nThe Master coughed and shifted his position slightly.  \"The lesson is\nover for today,\" he said.\n\n4.4\n\nPrince Wang's programmer was coding software.  His fingers danced upon\nthe keyboard.  The program compiled without and error message, and the\nprogram ran like a gentle wind.\n\n\"Excellent!\"  the Prince exclaimed.  \"Your technique is faultless!\"\n\n\"Technique?\"  said the programmer, turning from his terminal, \"What I\nfollow is Tao -- beyond all techniques!  When I first began to\nprogram, I would see before me the whole problem in one mass.  After\nthree years, I no longer saw this mass.  Instead, I used subroutines.\nBut now I see nothing.  My whole being exists in a formless void.  My\nsenses are idle.  My spirit, free to work without a plan, follows its\nown instinct.  In short, my program writes itself.  True, sometimes\nthere are difficult problems.  I see them coming, I slow down, I watch\nsilently.  Then I change a single line of code and the difficulties\nvanish like puffs of idle smoke.  I then compile the program.  I sit\nstill and let the joy of the work fill my being.  I close my eyes for\na moment and then log off.\"\n\nPrince Wang said, \"Would that all of my programmers were as wise!\"\n\nBOOK 5\nMaintenance\nThus spake the Master Programmer:\n \"Though a program be but three lines long,\nsomeday it will have to be maintained.\"\n\n5.1\n\nA well-used door needs no oil on its hinges.\n\nA swift-flowing stream does not grow stagnant.\n\nA deer blends perfectly into the forest colors.\n\nSoftware rots if not used.\n\nThese are great mysteries.\n\n5.2\n\nA manager asked a programmer how long it would take him to finish the\nprogram on which he was working.  \"I will be finished tomorrow,\" the\nprogrammer promptly replied.\n\n\"I think you are being unrealistic,\" said the manager, \"Truthfully,\nhow long will it take?\"\n\nThe programmer thought for a moment.  \"I have some features that I\nwish to add.  This will take at least two weeks,\" he finally said.\n\n\"Even that is too much to expect,\" insisted the manager, \"I will be\nsatisfied if you simply tell me when the program is complete.\"\n\nThe programmer agreed to this.\n\nSeveral years later, the manager retired.  On the way to his\nretirement luncheon, he discovered the programmer asleep at his\nterminal.  He had been programming all night.\n\n5.3\n\nA novice programmer was once assigned to code a simple financial\npackage.\n\nThe novice worked furiously for many days, but when his Master\nreviewed his program, he discovered it contained a screen editor, a\nset of generalized graphics routines, and an artificial intelligence\ninterface, but not the slightest hint of anything financial.\n\nWhen the Master asked about this, the novice became indignant.  \"Don't\nbe so impatient,\" he said, \"I'll put in the financial stuff\neventually.\"\n\n5.4\n\nDoes a good farmer neglect a crop he has planted?\n\nDoes a good teacher overlook even the most humble student?\n\nDoes a good father allow a single child to starve?\n\nDoes a good programmer refuse to maintain his code?\n\n\nBOOK 6\nManagement\nThus spake the Master Programmer:\n \"Let the programmers be many and the managers few\n-- then all will be productive.\"\n\n6.1\n\nWhen managers hold endless meetings, the programmers write games.\n\nWhen accountants speak of quarterly profits, the development budget is\nabout to be cut.\n\nWhen senior scientists talk blue sky, the clouds are about to roll in.\n\nTruly, this is not the Tao of Programming.\n\nWhen managers make commitments, game programs are ignored.\n\nWhen accountants make long-range plans, harmony and order are about to\nbe restored.\n\nWhen senior scientists address the problems at hand, the problems will\nsoon be solved.\n\nTruly, this is the Tao of Programming.\n\n6.2\n\nWhy are programmers non-productive?  Because their time is wasted in\nmeetings.\n\nWhy are programmers rebellious?  Because the management interferes too\nmuch.\n\nWhy are the programmers resigning one by one?  Because they are burnt\nout.\n\nHaving worked for poor management, they no longer value their jobs.\n\n\n6.3\n\nA manager was about to be fired, but a programmer who worked for him\nwrote a new program that became popular and sold well.  As a result,\nthe manager retained his job.\n\nThe manager tried to give the programmer a bonus, but the programmer\nrefused it, saying, \"I wrote the program because I thought it was an\ninteresting concept, and thus I expect no reward.\"\n\nThe manager upon hearing this remarked, \"This programmer, though he\nholds a position of small esteem, understands well the proper duty of\nan employee.  Let us promote him to the exalted position of management\nconsultant!\"\n\nBut when told this, the programmer once more refused, saying, \"I exist\nso that I can program.  If I were promoted, I would do nothing but\nwaste everyone's time.  Can I go now?  I have a program that I am\nworking on.\"\n\n6.4\n\nA manager went to his programmers and told them: \"As regards to your\nwork hours: you are going to have to come in at nine in the morning\nand leave at five in the afternoon.\"  At this, all of them became\nangry and several resigned on the spot.\n\nSo the manager said: \"All right, in that case you may set your own\nworking hours, as long as you finish your projects on schedule.\"  The\nprogrammers, now satisfied, began to come in at noon and work to the\nwee hours of the morning.\n\nBOOK 7\nCorporate Wisdom\nThus spake the Master Programmer:\n \"You can demonstrate a program for a corporate\nexecutive, but you can't make him computer literate.\"\n\n7.1\n\nA novice asked the Master: \"In the East, there is a great\ntree-structure that men call 'Corporate Headquarters'.  It is bloated\nout of shape with vice presidents and accountants.  It issues a\nmultitude of memos, each saying 'Go Hence!' or 'Go Hither!' and nobody\nknows what is meant.  Every year new names are put onto the branches,\nbut all to no avail.  How can such an unnatural entity exist?\"\n\nThe Master replied: \"You perceive this immense structure and are\ndisturbed that it has no rational purpose.  Can you not take amusement\nfrom its endless gyrations?  Do you not enjoy the untroubled ease of\nprogramming beneath its sheltering branches?  Why are you bothered by\nits uselessness?\"\n\n7.2\n\nIn the East there is a shark which is larger than all other fish.  It\nchanges into a bird whose wings are like clouds filling the sky.  When\nthis bird moves across the land, it brings a message from Corporate\nHeadquarters.  This message it drops into the midst of the\nprogrammers, like a seagull making its mark upon the beach.  Then the\nbird mounts on the wind and, with the blue sky at its back, returns\nhome.\n\nThe novice programmer stares in wonder at the bird, for he understands\nit not.  The average programmer dreads the coming of the bird, for he\nfears its message.  The Master Programmer continues to work at his\nterminal, unaware that the bird has come and gone.\n\n7.3\n\nThe Magician of the Ivory Tower brought his latest invention for the\nMaster Programmer to examine.  The Magician wheeled a large black box\ninto the Master's office while the Master waited in silence.\n\n\"This is an integrated, distributed, general-purpose workstation,\"\nbegan the Magician, \"ergonomically designed with a proprietary\noperating system, sixth generation languages, and multiple state of\nthe art user interfaces.  It took my assistants several hundred man\nyears to construct.  Is it not amazing?\"\n\nThe Master Programmer raised his eyebrows slightly.  \"It is indeed\namazing,\" he said.\n\n\"Corporate Headquarters has commanded,\" continued the Magician, \"that\neveryone use this workstation as a platform for new programs.  Do you\nagree to this?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" replied the Master.  \"I will have it transported to the\nData Center immediately!\"  And the Magician returned to his tower,\nwell pleased.\n\nSeveral days later, a novice wandered into the office of the Master\nProgrammer and said, \"I cannot find the listing for my new program.\nDo you know where it might be?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the Master, \"the listings are stacked on the platform\nin the Data Center.\"\n\n7.4\n\nThe Master Programmer moves from program to program without fear.  No\nchange in management can harm him.  He will not be fired, even if the\nproject is cancelled.  Why is this?  He is filled with Tao.\n\nBOOK 8\nHardware and Software\nThus spake the Master Programmer:\n \"Without the wind, the grass does not move.\nWithout software hardware is useless.\"\n\n8.1\n\nA novice asked the Master: \"I perceive that one computer company is\nmuch larger than all others.  It towers above its competition like a\ngiant among dwarfs.  Any one of its divisions could comprise an entire\nbusiness.  Why is this so?\"\n\nThe Master replied, \"Why do you ask such foolish questions?  That\ncompany is large because it is large.  If it only made hardware,\nnobody would buy it.  If it only made software, nobody would use it.\nIf it only maintained systems, people would treat it like a servant.\nBut because it combines all of these things, people think it one of\nthe gods!  By not seeking to strive, it conquers without effort.\"\n\n8.2\n\nA Master Programmer passed a novice programmer one day.\n\nThe Master noted the novice's preoccupation with a hand-held computer\ngame.\n\n\"Excuse me,\" he said, \"may I examine it?\"\n\nThe novice bolted to attention and handed the device to the Master.\n\"I see that the device claims to have three levels of play: Easy,\nMedium, and Hard,\" said the Master.  \"Yet every such device has\nanother level of play, where the device seeks not to conquer the\nhuman, nor to be conquered by the human.\"\n\n\"Pray, Great Master,\" implored the novice, \"how does one find this\nmysterious setting?\"\n\nThe Master dropped the device to the ground and crushed it with his\nheel.  Suddenly the novice was enlightened.\n\n8.3\n\nThere was once a programmer who wrote software for personal computers.\n\"Look at how well off I am here,\" he said to a mainframe programmer\nwho came to visit.  \"I have my own operating system and file storage\ndevice.  I do not have to share my resources with anyone.  The\nsoftware is self-consistent and easy-to-use.  Why do you not quit your\npresent job and join me here?\"\n\nThe mainframe programmer then began to describe his system to his\nfriend, saying, \"The mainframe sits like an ancient Sage meditating in\nthe midst of the Data Center.  Its disk drives lie end-to- end like a\ngreat ocean of machinery.  The software is as multifaceted as a\ndiamond, and as convoluted as a primeval jungle.  The programs, each\nunique, move through the system like a swift-flowing river.  That is\nwhy I am happy where I am.\"\n\nThe personal computer programmer, upon hearing this, fell silent.

Enter an interactive Python interpreter in a shell on an X console. \nStep 1 - can _tkinter be imported?\nTry the following command at the Python prompt: >>> import _tkinter # with underscore, and lowercase 't' If it works, go to step 2. If it fails with \"No module named _tkinter\", your Python configuration needs to be modified to include this module (which is an extension module implemented in C). Do **not** edit Modules/Setup (it is out of date). You may have to install Tcl and Tk (when using RPM, install the -devel RPMs as well) and/or edit the setup.py script to point to the right locations where Tcl/Tk is installed. If you install Tcl/Tk in the default locations, simply rerunning \"make\" should build the _tkinter extension. If it fails with an error from the dynamic linker, see above (for Unix, check for a header/library file mismatch; for Windows, check that the TCL/TK DLLs can be found). \nStep 2 - can Tkinter be imported?\nTry the correct command for your version at the Python prompt: >>> import Tkinter # no underscore, uppercase 'T' for versions prior to V3.0 >>> import tkinter # no underscore, lowercase 't' for V3.0 and later If it works, go to step 3. If it fails with \"No module named Tkinter\", your Python configuration need to be changed to include the directory that contains Tkinter.py in its default module search path. You have probably forgotten to define TKPATH in the Modules/Setup file. A temporary workaround would be to find that directory and add it to your PYTHONPATH environment variable. It is the subdirectory named \"lib-tk\" of the Python library directory (when using Python 1.4 or before, it is named \"tkinter\"). \nStep 3 - does Tkinter work?\nTry the correct command for your Python version at the Python prompt: >>> Tkinter._test() # note underscore in _test and uppercase 'T' for versions prior to V3.0  >>> tkinter._test() # note underscore in _test and lowercase 'T' for V3.0 and later This should pop up a small window with two buttons. Clicking the \"Quit\" button makes it go away and the command return. If this works, you're all set. (When running this test on Windows, from Python run in a MS-DOS console, the new window somehow often pops up *under* the console window. This can also occur when using iTerm on Mac OS X. Move it aside or locate the Tk window in the Taskbar / Dock.) If this doesn't work, study the error message you get; if you can't see how to fix the problem, ask for help.

Vaudenay AttackThis is probably the best-known example of how performing a cryptographic operation before verifying the MAC on a message can go wrong. In general, there are three different ways to combine a message authentication code with an encrypted message:Authenticate And Encrypt : The sender computes a MAC of the plaintext, encrypts the plaintext, and then appends the MAC to the ciphertext. Ek1(P) || MACk2(P)Authenticate Then Encrypt : The sender computes a MAC of the plaintext, then encrypts both the plaintext and the MAC. Ek1(P || MACk2(P))Encrypt Then Authenticate : The sender encrypts the plaintext, then appends a MAC of the ciphertext. Ek1(P) || MACk2(Ek1(P))The first often fails badly, the second mostly works, and the third is generally optimal. The third way, “encrypt-then-authenticate,” is optimal because it does not violate the doom principle. When you receive a message, the very first thing you can do is verify the MAC.By contrast, although “authenticate-then-encrypt” works at first glance, it does violate the doom principle. In order to verify the MAC, the recipient first has to decrypt the message, since the MAC is part of the encrypted payload. Many protocol designers (including the designers of SSL) did not see this as a problem, however, and so decided to test the inevitability of doom.Vaudenay’s well-known attack delivers.In order to decrypt ciphertext that was encrypted in CBC mode, as part of the decryption process one has to remove the padding that was originally appended to the plaintext (in order to make it a multiple of the underlying cipher’s block size). There are a number of different padding formats, but the most popular (as defined in PKCS#5 ) is to append the necessary N bytes of a value of N. So if a block needs to be padded out by 5 bytes, for insance, one would append 5 bytes of the value 0x05.When receiving a message, one would decrypt it, look at the value of the last byte (call it N), and then insure that the preceding N-1 bytes also had the value of N. Should they have an incorrect value, one has encountered a padding error, and should abort. Since the MAC is part of the encrypted payload, all of this needs to happen before the MAC can be verified. And thus, inevitable doom.If you’ll recall, the CBC decryption process looks like this:So if an attacker were to have a ciphertext message that they would like to decrypt, arbitrarily modifying the last byte of the second to last ciphertext block before sending it on to the recipient would have a deterministic effect on the last byte of the last ciphertext block. And that’s the byte the receiver is going to look at in order to process the padding.A receiver processing a message thus has two possible crypto-related error conditions: a padding error, and a MAC error. Sometimes protocols will emit different error responses to the sender based on the condition, but even if they don’t, a sender can often differentiate between the two conditions simply based on timing.This means that if an attacker were to take a ciphertext message and arbitrarily modify the last byte of the second to last block (R, as mentioned above), it would most likely trigger a padding error. This is because the attacker’s modification tweaks the value of the last byte of the last block, which is what the receiver is looking to for padding information. Instead of seeing 5 bytes of 0x05, for instance, the recipient will see 4 bytes of 0x05 and then a random byte of a different value.If the attacker cycles through enough modifications of R, however, (and there are only 8bits worth) they will eventually trigger a MAC error rather than a padding error. This is because the last byte of the last block will eventually get set to 0x01, which is valid padding. At that point the attacker knows that the real value of the last byte of the last ciphertext block is R xor 1. The attacker just decrypted a byte! They can then deterministicly set the last byte value to 0x02, and do the same thing with the second to last byte of the second to last block. And so on, until they’ve recovered the entire message. Doom.2. SSH Plaintext RecoveryThe following plaintext recovery attack against SSH is another particularly clever exploitation of the doom principle. The SSH packet format is as follows:We see that SSH has the same problem as above: in order to verify the MAC, one first has to decrypt the message. At first glance, however, SSH is safe, because the type of padding it uses does not make it vulnerable to Vaudenay. By specifying the padding length in a one byte field at a fixed location prior to the payload, it slips by.SSH has another strange feature, however, which is that the length of the message itself is encrypted. This means that before a recipient can verify the MAC, they first need to decrypt the first block of the message. Not just so that they can calculate the MAC over the plaintext, but so that they even know how long the message is, and how much data to read off the network in order to decrypt it!So before a recipient has verified the MAC on a message they receive, the very first thing they are going to do is decrypt the first block and interpret the first four bytes as the length of the message. Glossing over a few details, this means that if an attacker is holding a ciphertext block they would like to decrypt (perhaps from the middle of a previously transmitted message), they can simply send it to the recipient, who will decrypt it and parse the first four bytes as a length. The recipient will then proceed to read that many bytes off the network before verifiing the MAC. An attacker can then send one byte at a time, until the recipient encounters a MAC error and closes the connection. At this point the attacker will know what value the recipient interpreted that four byte length to be, thus revealing the first four bytes of plaintext in a ciphertext block. Doom again!In ConclusionThese are two of my favorite examples, but there are actually a number of other ways in which this has manifested itself. Watch out for it, because even if these particular cases don’t apply, the general pattern will somehow inevitably cause trouble. It always does.TweetVote on HNStay in touch,Follow @moxie !function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document,\"script\",\"twitter-wjs\"); ", "url": "https://moxie.org/blog/the-cryptographic-doom-principle/", "hostname": "moxie.org", "category": "uncategorized", "item_id": 19256986, "item_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19256986", "root_id": 19256553, "original_title": null}, {"title": "Galois/Counter Mode - Wikipedia", "description": "Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) is a mode of operation for symmetric key cryptographic block ciphers that has been widely adopted because of its efficiency and performance.
