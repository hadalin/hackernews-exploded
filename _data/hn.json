Native in Hungarian, she was able to interpret fluently in nine or ten languages (in four of them even without preparation), and she translated technical literature and read belles-lettres in six languages. She was able to understand journalism in further eleven languages. As she put it, altogether she earned money with sixteen languages (Bulgarian, Chinese, Danish, English, French, German, Hebrew, Italian, Japanese, Latin, Polish, Romanian, Russian, Slovak, Spanish, Ukrainian). She learned these languages mostly by self-effort, as an autodidact.

As its title suggests, this book provides a “one stop  shop” on sudoku, covering the history of the puzzle, its  development and growth in the world’s media, before moving on  to the mathematics of sudoku and various techniques that can be  used to solve grids by hand.  Next, the essentials of software development relating to sudoku are  presented along with the recent branch of computer science devoted  to solving such problems: constraint programming, showing how the  principle behind solving sudoku grids can be used in other  contexts. Finally, the book concludes with a large number of grids  ranging in difficulty from “very easy” to  “expert” which the reader can use to apply the  techniques they have acquired from the book in a practical  context.  Those interested in finding out more about the theory behind  sudoku, its origins, it applications in other fields and (of  course) how to improve their ability to solve it will find this  book a must-read.", "url": "https://www.wiley.com/en-us/A+to+Z+of+Sudoku-p-9781847040008", "hostname": "www.wiley.com", "category": "uncategorized", "comment_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19219368"}, {"title": "Summary: How to Start a Startup (YC)", "description": "By Charles Wong Chapter 1: Foundation (Sam Altman) Why Should You Start a Startup?

In cases where the parties disagree on what the law is, a common law court looks to past precedential decisions of relevant courts, and synthesizes the principles of those past cases as applicable to the current facts.  If a similar dispute has been resolved in the past, the court is usually bound to follow the reasoning used in the prior decision (a principle known as stare decisis). If, however, the court finds that the current dispute is fundamentally distinct from all previous cases (called a \"matter of first impression\"), and legislative statutes are either silent or ambiguous on the question, judges have the authority and duty to resolve the issue (one party or the other has to win, and on disagreements of law, judges make that decision).[7] The court states an opinion that gives reasons for the decision, and those reasons agglomerate with past decisions as precedent to bind future judges and litigants. Common law, as the body of law made by judges,[3][8] stands in contrast to and on equal footing with statutes which are adopted through the legislative process, and regulations which are promulgated by the executive branch (the interactions among these different sources of law are explained later in this article).  Stare decisis, the principle that cases should be decided according to consistent principled rules so that similar facts will yield similar results, lies at the heart of all common law systems.[9]\n", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_law#Common_law_legal_systems_as_opposed_to_civil_law_legal_systems", "hostname": "en.wikipedia.org", "category": "wiki_article", "comment_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19213599"}, {"title": "Stop that!

In a U.S. historical context, the phrase 'Corporate Personhood' refers to the ongoing legal debate over the extent to which rights traditionally associated with natural persons should also be afforded to corporations. A headnote issued by the Court Reporter in the 1886 Supreme Court case Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad Co. claimed to state the sense of the Court regarding the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment as it applies to corporations, without the Court having actually made a decision or issued a written opinion on that point. This was the first time that the Supreme Court was reported to hold that the Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection clause granted constitutional protections to corporations as well as to natural persons, although numerous other cases, since Dartmouth College v. Woodward in 1819, had recognized that corporations were entitled to some of the protections of the Constitution. In Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. (2014), the Court found that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 exempted Hobby Lobby from aspects of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act because those aspects placed a substantial burden on the closely held company's owners' exercise of free religion.[2]\n", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_personhood", "hostname": "en.wikipedia.org", "category": "wiki_article", "comment_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19212031"}, {"title": "Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act - Wikipedia", "description": "The Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act of 1980 (FIRPTA), enacted as Subtitle C of Title XI (the \"Revenue Adjustments Act of 1980\") of the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1980, Pub.
