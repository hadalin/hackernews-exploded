Doyne Farmer: The first thing that makes me respect Murray is that unlike all his contemporaries, including Feynman, Weinberg, Hawking, and all the other particle physicists, he saw that complexity is the next big problem. The kind of breakthroughs he made in the early 1960s in terms of impact on the world of science are not going to get made in that domain, they are going to get made in this domain. Murray recognized that, and has become mor...", "url": "https://www.edge.org/conversation/murray_gell_mann-chapter-19-plectics", "hostname": "www.edge.org", "category": "uncategorized", "item_id": 19760682, "item_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19760682", "root_id": null, "original_title": "Plectics - The study of simplicity and complexity (1996)"}, {"title": "Stephen Hawking's advice for twenty-first century grads: Embrace complexity", "description": null, "url": "https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/the-curious-wavefunction/stephen-hawkings-advice-for-twenty-first-century-grads-embrace-complexity/", "hostname": "blogs.scientificamerican.com", "category": "uncategorized", "item_id": 19778274, "item_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19778274", "root_id": 19760682, "original_title": null}, {"title": "SFI Community Lecture - Srividya Iyer-Biswas", "description": "Laws of Life, Time and Chance We all intuitively understand what is alive and what is not.
