Today designated 1I/'Oumuamua, it shows characteristics that have\nnever before been observed in a celestial body. Due to these characteristics,\nan in-situ investigation of 1I would be of extraordinary scientific value.\nPrevious studies have demonstrated that a mission to 1I/'Oumuamua is feasible,\nusing current and near-term technologies. However, the anticipated launch date\nof 2020-2021 is too soon to be realistic. In this paper, we demonstrate that a\nmission to 1I/'Oumuamua is feasible at an even later point in time, providing\nsufficient time for developing a spacecraft. Using the OITS trajectory\nsimulation tool, various scenarios are analyzed, including a powered Jupiter\nflyby and Solar Oberth manoeuvre, a Jupiter powered flyby, and more complex\nflyby schemes including a Mars and Venus flyby. With a powered Jupiter flyby\nand Solar Oberth manoeuvre, we identify a trajectory to 1I/'Oumuamua with a\nlaunch date in 2033, a total velocity increment of 18.6 km/s, and arrival at\n1I/'Oumuamua in 2049. With an additional deep space manoeuvre before the\npowered Jupiter flyby, a trajectory with a launch date in 2030, a total\nvelocity increment of 16.2 km/s, and an arrival at 1I/'Oumuamua in 2047 were\nidentified. Both launch dates would provide over a decade for spacecraft\ndevelopment, in contrast to the previously identified 2020-2021 launch dates.\nWe conclude that a mission to 1I/'Oumuamua is feasible, using existing and\nnear-term technologies and there is sufficient time for developing such a\nmission.", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.04935", "hostname": "arxiv.org", "category": "uncategorized", "comment_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19204914"}, {"title": "6 Strange Facts about the Interstellar Visitor 'Oumuamua", "description": null, "url": "https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/6-strange-facts-about-the-interstellar-visitor-oumuamua/", "hostname": "blogs.scientificamerican.com", "category": "uncategorized", "comment_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19203340"}, {"title": "Gravity assist - Wikipedia", "description": "In orbital mechanics and aerospace engineering, a gravitational slingshot, gravity assist maneuver, or swing-by is the use of the relative movement (e.g. orbit around the Sun) and gravity of a planet or other astronomical object to alter the path and speed of a spacecraft, typically to save propellant and reduce expense. \n", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_assist", "hostname": "en.wikipedia.org", "category": "wiki_article", "comment_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19202280"}, {"title": "Rendezvous with Rama - Wikipedia", "description": "\n", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rendezvous_with_Rama", "hostname": "en.wikipedia.org", "category": "wiki_article", "comment_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19202138"}, {"title": "Crookes radiometer - Wikipedia", "description": "\n", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crookes_radiometer", "hostname": "en.wikipedia.org", "category": "wiki_article", "comment_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19203008"}, {"title": "Why the Last Words of Anne Boleyn Remain a Mystery", "description": "What she said depends on who's telling the story.", "url": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/why-the-last-words-of-anne-boleyn-remain-a-mystery", "hostname": "www.atlasobscura.com", "category": "uncategorized", "comment_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19197090"}, {"title": "SMBlog -- 19 February 2019", "description": "\nMicrosoft is \nshipping\na patch\nto eliminate SHA-1 hashes from its update process. \nThere's nothing wrong with eliminating SHA-1—but their reasoning may\nbe very interesting.\n\nSHA-1 is a \"cryptographic hash function\". That is, it takes an input\nfile of any size and outputs 20 bytes. An essential property of\ncryptographic hash functions is that in practice (though obviously not\nin theory), no two files should have the same hash value unless the files\nare identical.\n\nSHA-1 no longer has that property;\nwe've known that for about 15 years.\nBut definitions matter. SHA-1 is susceptible to a \"collision attack\":\nan attacker can simultaneously create two files that have the same\nSHA-1 hash. However, given an existing file and hence its hash, it is\nnot possible, as far as anyone knows, to generate a second file\nwith that same hash. This attack, called a \"pre-image attack\", is far\nmore serious. (There's a third type of attack, a \"second pre-image attack\",\nwhich I won't go into.)\n\nIn the ordinary sequence of events, someone at Microsoft prepares an update\nfile. Its hash—its SHA-1 hash, in many cases—is calculated; this value\nis then digitally signed. Someone who wished to create a fake update\nwould have to crack either the signature algorithm or, somehow, produce\na fake update that had the same hash value as the legitimate update.\nBut that's a pre-image attack, and SHA-1 is still believed to be secure\nagainst those. So: is this update useless? Not quite—there's still a\nrisk.\n\nRecall that SHA-1 is vulnerable to a collision attack. This means that\nif two updates are prepared simultaneously, one good and one evil, there\ncan be a signed, malicious update. In other words, the threat model here\nis a corrupt insider.\nBy eliminating use of SHA-1 for updates, Microsoft is protecting\nusers against misbehavior by one of its own employees.\n\nNow, perhaps this is just housekeeping. Microsoft can get SHA-1 out of\nits code base, and thus discourage its use. And it's past time to do\nthat; the algorithm is about 25 years old and does have serious weaknesses.\nBut it's also recognition that an insider who turns to the Dark Side\ncan be very dangerous.\n", "url": "https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~smb/blog/2019-02/2019-02-19.html", "hostname": "www.cs.columbia.edu", "category": "uncategorized", "comment_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19205596"}, {"title": "Mandatory update coming to Windows 7, 2008 to kill off weak update hashes", "description": "Microsoft is phasing out SHA-1 hashes on its patches.", "url": "https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/02/mandatory-update-coming-to-windows-7-2008-to-kill-off-weak-update-hashes/", "hostname": "arstechnica.com", "category": "uncategorized", "comment_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19206323"}, {"title": "Announcing the first SHA1 collision", "description": "Posted by Marc Stevens (CWI Amsterdam), Elie Bursztein (Google), Pierre Karpman (CWI Amsterdam), Ange Albertini (Google), Yarik Markov (Goog...", "url": "https://security.googleblog.com/2017/02/announcing-first-sha1-collision.html", "hostname": "security.googleblog.com", "category": "uncategorized", "comment_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19207482"}, {"title": "Who Was the 12th Russian Spy at Microsoft?", "description": "Alexey Karetnikov tested software at the Redmond giant", "url": "https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2010/07/who-was-the-12th-russian-spy-at-microsoft/344876/", "hostname": "www.theatlantic.com", "category": "uncategorized", "comment_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19206291"}, {"title": "cr-marcstevens/sha1collisiondetection", "description": "Library and command line tool to detect SHA-1 collision in a file - cr-marcstevens/sha1collisiondetection", "url": "https://github.com/cr-marcstevens/sha1collisiondetection", "hostname": "github.com", "category": "repository", "comment_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19207774"}, {"title": "\r\n\tNIST Policy on Hash Functions - Hash Functions | CSRC\r\n", "description": "This is a potential security issue, you are being redirected to https://csrc.nist.gov", "url": "https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/hash-functions/nist-policy-on-hash-functions", "hostname": "csrc.nist.gov", "category": "uncategorized", "comment_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19206527"}, {"title": null, "description": null, "url": "https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-131A", "hostname": "doi.org", "category": "uncategorized", "comment_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19206527"}, {"title": null, "description": null, "url": "https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-131Ar1", "hostname": "doi.org", "category": "uncategorized", "comment_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19206527"}, {"title": "{{search404Captions.content404Title}}", "description": " Please enable cookies and refresh the page ", "url": "https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4472027/2019-sha-2-code-signing-support-requirement-for-windows-and-wsus", "hostname": "support.microsoft.com", "category": "uncategorized", "comment_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19206527"}, {"title": "Still Using Windows 7?

So while we are making very good progress, it is a stretch to say that Debian is reproducible. Most packages built in sid today are reproducible under a fixed build-path and environment. We have a new control file *.buildinfo that records the build environment, see deb-buildinfo for reference. Older design drafts are here. We have a continuous integration platform that builds and immediately rebuilds packages. With this we can detect problems related to timestamps, file ordering, CPU usage, (pseudo-)randomness and other things. We are examining packages and sorting out common problems. Many patches have already been submitted, and we are continuously writing new ones. You can check which packages installed on your system are still unreproducible by using the reproducible-check script in the devscripts package. \nBig outstanding issues\nThese are the critical items necessary to have reproducible builds for at least the required packages of Debian #763822: ftp.debian.org: please include .buildinfo file in the archive, with this two related bugs:  #862073: ftp.debian.org: Please POST .buildinfo files to buildinfo.debian.net #862538: security.debian.org: Please POST .buildinfo files to buildinfo.debian.net #900918: debian-installer: Please make the generated images reproducible User-facing interfaces (see proof-of-concept in #863622: apt: warn when installing packages that are not reproducible #900837: Mass-rebuild of packages for reproducible builds currently debian-policy says \"packages should be reproducible\", though we aim for \"packages must be reproducible\" though it's still a long road until we'll be there: currently (Oct 2018) there are more than 1250 unreproducible packages in Buster, thus if policy would be changed today, 1250 packages would need to be kicked out of Buster (well, or fixed) immediatly, so this policy change right now is not feasable. \nAnnoying but not major\n#869184: dpkg: source uploads including _amd64.buildinfo cause problems #802241: dpkg: please store the hash of the installed .deb and allow to query it #894441: binNMUs should be replaced by easy \"no-change-except-debian/changelog-uploads\" \nNice to have\nTighten up the Policy definition of \"reproducible\" to be stricter about environment variables and build paths. Discuss which environment variables we should blacklist or whitelist, 876055. There are many other possible nice-to-haves, e.g., making builds independent of their build directory, making it possible to create archive formats (like tar.gz and zip) with different tools yet result in the same byte order, etc.  Many of those are valuable, but they shouldn't distract from getting the results of reproducible builds out to users. \nNext\nFor more concrete tasks to be done, look at how to contribute.
