Supporting farmers to monitor soil health could help to achieve the policy aspiration of sustainable soils by 2030 in England; however, little is known about how to overcome participation barriers, appropriate methodologies (practical, cost-effective, usefulness) or training needs. This paper presents the results from a pilot #60minworms study which mobilised farmers to assess over >1300 ha farmland soils in spring 2018. The results interpretation framework is based on the presence of earthworms from each of the three ecological groups at each observation (20 x 20 cm x 20 cm pit) and spatially across a field (10 soil pits). Results showed that most fields have basic earthworm presence and abundance, but 42% fields may be over-worked as indicated by absence/rarity of epigeic and/or anecic earthworms. Tillage had a negative impact (p < 0.05) on earthworm populations and organic matter management did not mitigate tillage impacts. In terms of farmer participation, Twitter and Farmers Weekly magazine were highly effective channels for recruitment. Direct feedback from participants included excellent scores in trust, value and satisfaction of the protocol (e.g. 100% would do the test again) and 57% would use their worm survey results to change their soil management practices. A key training need in terms of earthworm identification skills was reported. The trade-off between data quality, participation rates and fieldwork costs suggests there is potential to streamline the protocol further to #30minworms (5 pits), incurring farmer fieldwork costs of approximately £1.48 ha-1. At national scales, £14 million pounds across 4.7 M ha-1 in fieldwork costs per survey could be saved by farmer participation.", "url": "https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0203909", "hostname": "journals.plos.org", "category": "uncategorized", "item_id": 19242130, "item_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19242130", "root_id": 19241246, "original_title": null}, {"title": "Private Internet Access' \"No-Logging\" Claims Proven True Again in Court - TorrentFreak", "description": "VPN provider Private Internet Access, which has a strict no-logging policy, has proven once again that it is unable to link online activities with a user's identity.

We and some\nothers think there are currently two aspects of WireGuard that make\nits deployment in a privacy-focused setting a bit challenging. The\ngoal of this email is to present current thoughts on the issues and\nfacilitate discussion. It contains language and ideas from others who\nhave commented on this elsewhere. Thank you. Feel free to make\nyourselves known. Any errors are mine however.\n\nThe two issues are:\n* WireGuard does not offer identity hiding forward secrecy\n* WireGuard does not offer dynamic IP address assignment\n\nTogether with other interested parties I hope to arrive at a good\nsolution to these issues, which can be adopted by any apps that want\nto offer privacy. The time to do this is now, before WireGuard reaches\nmassive adoption and multiple incompatible hacks are made.\n\nYou might care about this if you:\n* Run a VPN proxy/server where you or your users care about privacy\n* Use a commercial VPN service\n* Provide a commercial VPN service\n\n\n-WireGuard does not offer identity hiding forward secrecy-\n\n--The problem--\nIn the context of a VPN service the peers can be viewed as Client(s)\nand Server. A key compromise of the VPN server's static private key\nmakes an attacker able to decrypt recorded handshakes and thus\ncorrelate all connections made using any given client static key, i.e.\nVPN user. Here's how:\n\n1. An attacker records encrypted traffic flows to/from a VPN server.\n\n2. Time passes. The attacker gets hold of the VPN server's static\nprivate key, by raiding a data centre, breaking into a VPN server\nhost, or something else.\n\n3. The attacker uses the VPN server static private key to decrypt the\nrecorded handshakes, revealing client static pubkeys.\n\n4. The attacker uses client static pubkeys to correlate traffic flows\nwith particular users including possibly linking individuals to client\npubkeys through other data sources, e.g. VPN provider business records\nor other IP address metadata.\n\n--Nuances--\nA successful attack requires both the capability to record traffic\nflows as well as to compromise the server key. Still, the lack of\nidentity hiding forward secrecy means WireGuard offers worse privacy\nthan e.g. OpenVPN in this respect.\n\nIt should be noted that both WireGuard and OpenVPN send tunnel session\nIDs in the clear. A user that roams between networks will probably\nleak the session ID between them. On the other hand, a user that\nexplicitly disconnects on network 1 and reconnects the VPN tunnel on\nnetwork 2 will have a new tunnel session ID that is not linkable to\nthe first one. In this case OpenVPN (assuming user/pass auth and not\nclient-cert) will have identity hiding forward secrecy, and WireGuard\ndoes not.\n\nIf a WireGuard user application connects with a new pubkey every time\na new tunnel is established, it will provide the same identity hiding\nproperties as OpenVPN. However depending on the position of the\nsurveillance equipment and the method of key compromise neither\nOpenVPN nor WireGuard would be sufficient protection. That's\nout-of-scope for this discussion however.\n\n--Proposed mitigation--\nIn order to get identity hiding forward secrecy the suggestion is to\nhave the client change its static pubkey often in order to de-link VPN\nsessions, in the event of a compromise of the server's static private\nkey. “Often” might be a time limit, a bandwidth limit, and events like\nreboot of the system, the app, new WiFi, new DHCP lease, or explicitly\nby the user. To provide the same properties as OpenVPN it should be\nenough to change pubkey every time the user does a connect/disconnect.\n\nThis should probably be a functionality on top of WireGuard, which\nshould stay minimal. It should be possible for clients to register new\nstatic pubkeys with the VPN service and to ask it to forget about old\npubkeys. One current idea is to define a service on top of WireGuard\nrunning as a daemon on both client and server, communicating over a\nWireGuard session.\n\n\n-WireGuard does not offer dynamic IP address assignment-\n\n--The problem--\nThe tunnel-internal IP address can leak through WebRTC and perhaps\nother ways. A long term IP address assignment could enable a website\nthat exfiltrates the IP address to use it as a unique identifier\nbetween website visits, even if the user has cleared all browsing\ndata. There are other ways of doing this.\n\nA perhaps more serious consequence of static assignment is that the IP\naddress is stored linked to a user's static public key, which in turn\nmight be linked to a user’s personal identity through the server’s\nauthentication system. If the attacker learns the IP address as well\nas gains access to the user database, it might be able to link the IP\naddress to a person.\n\nIn a commercial VPN service setup, the IP address and thus its static\npublic key are probably linked to a customer account, and to payment\ninformation. If this is the case, an attacker might be able to\nidentify the user. There are various mitigations and hacks one could\ndo as an operator to prevent this. Regardless, an approach to\nephemeral IP addresses that is accepted as standard would be\npreferable.\n\n--Proposed mitigation--\nMake it possible for clients to request a dynamically assigned IP\naddress from the VPN server. One idea is to define a service on top of\nWireGuard running as a daemon on both client and server, communicating\nover a WireGuard session. The client would need a statically assigned\nlink-local IPv6 address and use that to communicate with the\nserver-side daemon, which then assigns an IP address dynamically.\n\n\n-What's been done already?-\n\nAn effort has already started regarding the dynamic IP addresses. Read\nthe following for more info:\nhttps://www.wireguard.com/todo/\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/11RJDDrdIsnGivz8xP5NsOteHdviuV4jfNG1CSl0q8cY/edit\nhttps://git.zx2c4.com/wg-dynamic\n\nOne issue with an in-tunnel daemon is authentication of client and\nserver. It’s possible the client side of the WireGuard tunnel is\nactually a router for many more clients, who probably shouldn’t be\nauthorized to renegotiate the router’s dynamic IP address or pubkey.\nAn alternative to an in-tunnel daemon would be to use peer-addressed\ndatagrams for control messages instead, but that introduces other\ncomplexities as mentioned in the documents above.\n\n\n-Summary-\nA privacy-focused deployment of WireGuard should provide identity\nhiding forward secrecy and short-term dynamic IP address assignment.\nWireGuard provides neither, since it's out-of-scope for the project's\ngoals, for good reasons. One solution would be to define a service\nthat communicates over a WireGuard tunnel. The same service could\nprovide API calls for both needs, as well as other things.\n\nFinally, it would be good if the mechanism and protocol remained the\nsame regardless of if one was connecting to a lone WireGuard server,\nor to a WireGuard server in a network of many, such as a large VPN\nservice provider. I for one expect WireGuard to become the standard\nVPN protocol for VPN services within a few years, and that they will\ncontinue to grow until then. To my knowledge the largest ones today\nrun almost 10,000 servers.\n\n\nThank you for your time.\n\nBest regards,\nFredrik Stromberg\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious message: Support ip6tables-like network masks for allowed-ips besides CIDR\n\nNext message: WireGuard deployment considerations for improved privacy\n\n Messages sorted by:\n[ date ]\n[ thread ]\n[ subject ]\n[ author ]\n\n\n\nMore information about the WireGuard\nmailing list\n", "url": "https://lists.zx2c4.com/pipermail/wireguard/2019-January/003777.html", "hostname": "lists.zx2c4.com", "category": "uncategorized", "item_id": 19244283, "item_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19244283", "root_id": 19242058, "original_title": null}, {"title": "WireGuard VPN: What You Need to Know - NOT (Yet) Recommended", "description": "WireGuard is an interesting new VPN protocol that has the potential to bring major change to the VPN industry.

A small\ncommercial VPN provider approached me recently about the fact they could see\nthe allowed IPs mapping easily with WireGuard, whereas with OpenVPN it was\nhidden deep inside a process they didn't know how to debug. \"Great,\" I\nthought. Not so fast. They were concerned that when compelled to retrieve this\nkind of information, they would no longer be able to claim, \"we don't know\nhow,\" since WireGuard makes it so easy. So, they hired me for a day to develop\nand open source a small solution for their unique use case and odd scenario.\n\nBefore reading further, do you have the same bizarre requirement? Probably\nnot. In that likely case, please keep reading only under the scope of,\n\"something somebody else thought they needed, but I don't need myself.\" In\nother words, don't use this code.\n\nNot wanting to hack up WireGuard or add configuration nobs -- or really\ncompromise any of what the project is about in response to these kinds of\nrequests -- I thought I'd write a small \"defensive rootkit,\" which most\ncertainly kills both your kitten and your neighbor's parrot.\n\nIt started out by just hooking the Netlink API to zero out the endpoints and\nallowedips for each peer. Then I disabled tcpdump. Then I disabled /dev/mem,\n/dev/kmem, /dev/port, /proc/kcore, and module loading. Things were looking\nfairly clean, until I needed to add compatibility support for old kernels, and\nthen I reverted to some cthulhu-style x86 opcode parsing and writing to proc\nfrom kernelspace and other atrocities. It seems to work relatively well on\nthe kernels I've tested, but of course there are no guarantees with this kind\nof stuff. In any case, there aren't very many public rootkit examples like\nthis, so at the very least it might be an aid to a college freshman doing an\nassignment for his \"Intro to Computer Security\" course.\n\nKeep in mind that there are several ways to subvert each and every defense\nthat this thing introduces. Several ways! All of the defenses! Subverted! For\nthat reason, you shouldn't use this if you're relying on the impossibility of\nsubversion. It's only meant as a confinement based on your own lack of\nknowledge on how to subvert it. As you learn more, the software becomes less\neffective.\n\nIf it's of any interest, it's online here:\nhttps://git.zx2c4.com/blind-operator-mode/about/\nhttps://git.zx2c4.com/blind-operator-mode/tree/blind-operator-mode.c\n$ git clone https://git.zx2c4.com/blind-operator-mode/\n\nEnjoy!
