This interval is the quantity of interest, since proper time itself is fixed only up to an arbitrary additive constant, namely the setting of the clock at some event along the world line. The proper time interval between two events depends not only on the events but also the world line connecting them, and hence on the motion of the clock between the events. It is expressed as an integral over the world line. An accelerated clock will measure a smaller elapsed time between two events than that measured by a non-accelerated (inertial) clock between the same two events.

By interacting with\nthe free electrons in the interstellar medium, pulses at lower frequencies\nare delayed. In other words, pulses emitted at higher frequencies arrive\nearlier than those emitted at lower frequencies. This effect is shown in\nFigure 1 which shows pulses at different, adjacent radio frequencies. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Real data showing the dispersion\neffect in the progressive delay of pulses to higher frequencies.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bottom of Figure 1 shows the pulse profile obtained after delaying\nthe high frequency pulses until the lowest frequency arrived before summing\nup all frequency channels. We call this process to correct for dispersion\n\"de-dispersion\". If the delay would not have been accounted for, the summed\npulse would have been blurred and smeared. If the delay is too big, the\npulses may become undetectable. The dispersion delay measured in milliseconds\nincreases at lower\nfrequencies as\n\n\nwhere the low and high\nare the lower and higher frequencies, respectively, measured in MHz. \nThe constant\nDM is called the \"dispersion measure\" and increases with distance and electron\ndensity between Earth and pulsar (see parts 4.4 and 4.5 below) and is measured in units of parsecs per cubic centimetre (a distance and an electron \ndensity as you shall see later). \nObservations are always made with a finite bandwidth, BW. The larger\nthe bandwidth, the more emission can be received, making the observations\nmore sensitive. Hence, one usually attempts to maximise the bandwidth.\nAt the same time, however, the dispersion smearing increases and the pulses\nobserved at a frequency   in MHz would be blurred by\n\nseconds per \nMHZ of bandwidth\nif no de-dispersion were done. The easiest way is usually to follow\nthe example of the above plot and to split the total bandwidth, BW, into\na number of smaller channels. The signals are then detected and delayed\nbefore summing as described above. Of course, there is still dispersion\nsmearing in each of the smaller channels, so that the channel width is\nchosen depending on observing frequency and aim of the observations. We\nwill review another de-dispersion method, which removes dispersion completely,\nbelow. \nThe sensitivity of the observation, or the \"signal-to-noise\" ratio describing\nthe strength of a signal compared to random noise, depends on more parameters\nthan just the bandwidth of the receiving system:\n\n\nThe size of the telescope matters, which is described by the \"gain\" parameter.\nThe larger the telescope, the larger the gain, G.\n\nEach piece of equipment involved produces a random thermal noise signal.\nThis is the reason why one tries to cool receivers to temperatures of only\na few degrees above absolute zero. Any remaining thermal noise signal is\ndescribed by the system noise temperature, Tsys.\n\nThermal noise is a random signal, while the pulsar signal arrives periodically\nwith the pulsar period. Averaging (\"integrating\") the received signals\nover a period of time, will therefore reduce the random noise relative\nto the real signal. Hence, the signal-to-noise ratio, \"SNR\" or \"S/N\", increases\nwith integration time, tint.\n\nA simple receiver system is only sensitive to one of two orthogonal polarisation\ndirections. One usually combines two such systems, to measure the intensity\nin both directions. Effectively, one then increases the used bandwidth\nby a factor equal to the number of received polarisations, Npol\n(max. 2).\n\nAll of the above considerations are combined in the equation displayed\nin Figure 2, where K is a constant of order unity and S the strength of\nthe pulsar. The diagram also summarises the typical situation during pulsar\nobservations. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Schematic of pulsar observing system.\nThe pulses emitted by the pulsar (upper right) propagate through the interstellar\nmedium (ISM), before being picked up by a telescope and the installed receiving\nsystem. In a standard approach the total bandwidth is split into smaller\nchannels by a filterbank (for each polarisation). The signals of each filterbank\nare acquired by a data acquisition system and recoded along with information\nfrom the observatory's atomic clock which is synchronised to an international\ntime standard with GPS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3. Illustration of the advantages of\ncoherent dedispersion in observations of PSR B1937+121.\n\n\n\nFigure 2 also shows another instrument, COBRA, which is being commissioned\nat the Jodrell Bank Observatory to replace the previous filterbank system.\nThis new system uses a de-dispersion method called \"coherent de-dispersion\"\nwhich is able to restore the original pulse shape completely. Although\nthis method requires substantial computing power, it removes all dispersion\nsmearing, producing much sharper pulses. Sharper pulses allow us to measure\nthe arrival times of pulses to a much higher precision which is important\nfor pulsar timing (see next section). The superiority of coherent de-dispersion\nover the \"incoherent\" filterbank method is shown for the pulse profile\nof PSR B1937+21 in Figure 3. \n\n\n\n4.2 Pulsar timing\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4(a). The residuals between a good model\nand actual pulse arrival times scatter around zero.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4(b). Increasing residuals due to wrong\nspin-down rate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4(c). Deviation with one year period\ndue to inaccurate position.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4(d). Deviation with one year period\nand increasing amplitude due to inaccurate proper motion.\n\n\n\n\nMany experiments involving pulsars are based on the ability to measure\nthe arrival times of their pulses. This technique is called \"pulsar timing\".\nFor instance, we have seen already that one can determine the age and the\nmagnetic field of pulsars by measuring the slow increase of pulse period\nwith time due to the slow down of their rotation. Many more applications\nwill be discussed after we reviewed all the effects which one has to take\ninto account. \nWe have already discussed the effects of dispersion on the arrival time\nof pulses. Much more fundamental is however, that the arrival time must\nbe different for any telescope and must also change with time of day and\ntime of year as any given telescope is moving in space due to the Earth's\nrotation and movement around the Sun. For our experiments we should refer\nto the arrival time at a point in the solar system which is at rest. Such\na point is the system's centre of mass, the so-called solar system barycentre. \nIf the pulsar is not too distant, we can measure a parallax effect in\nthe time of arrival providing a direct measurement of the pulsar distance.\n(To be precise, we measure the curvature of the incoming electromagnetic\nwaves!) \nGeneral relativity predicts additional delays when the pulse is propagating\nthrough gravitational potentials like that of the Sun. \nAll these effects have to be taken into account before we can attribute\nchanges in arrival time due to physical effects by the pulsar. We can summarise\nthem in the following equation which describes the transformation of the\nmeasured arrival to the time of emission in the pulsar frame.\n\n\nThe first term refers to a certain chosen epoch t0 as reference,\nthe second term describes the transformation to the solar system barycentre\n(r and s being vectors pointing from the telescope to the pulsar and Sun,\nrespectively), the third term accounts for dispersion with D being a constant\ndepending on the dispersion measure, while the fourth terns becomes relevant\nwhen the pulsar is close (d is the distance of the pulsars), so that parallax\neffects are important. The fifth term describes the aforementioned effects\npredicted by general relativity. \n\nThings become more complicated if the pulsar has a binary companion.\nIn that case, most of the effects present in the solar system will have\nto be accounted for in the binary system as well, which is indicated by\nthe last two terms. Binary pulsars are discussed in more detail in the\nnext section. \n\n\n\nAccounting for all possible effects including the pulsar spin down,\nwe should be able to predict the arrival times and to compare these predictions\nwith actual measurements. These differences between model predictions and\nobservations called \"residuals\" are plotted versus time and should vary\nrandomly around zero, as shown in Figure 4(a), if the model is correct. \n\nDeviations from a random appearance indicate unmodeled effects. \nAn inaccurate\nassumption about the pulsar spin down, for instance, leads to an increasing\ndeviation from the expected arrival time as in Figure 4(b). \n\n\nIf the assumed pulsar position is inaccurate, our transformation to\nthe solar system barycentre will be wrong too, creating a deviation from\nthe expected arrival time that depends on the position of the Earth in\nits orbit. Hence, the deviation will have a sinusoid shape with the period\nof one year, Figure 4(c). The amplitude then depends on the amount by which\nthe assumed position is wrong. \n\n\nIf the pulsar exhibits some proper motion that is not accounted for,\nits position must become increasingly inaccurate, producing an one-year\nsinusoid with increasing amplitude, Figure 4(d). \nIn an iterative procedure during which such deviations are identified,\nthe pulsar model is improved until the residuals show the expected random\ndistribution of Fig 4(a). Using this method, we can determine the pulse\nperiod and the pulsar spin down as well as astrometric parameters like\nposition and proper motion to an incredible accuracy. The accuracy achievable\nscales with the pulsar period, so that the best results are obtained for\nthe shortest periods i.e. the millisecond pulsars. The pulse period of\nPSR B1937+21 is, for instance, measured to be:\nP=0.0015578064924327 +/- 0.0000000000000004 seconds.\nSimilarly, positions and proper motions are measured to accuracies of\nmicroarcseconds and microarcseconds per year, respectively. This is better\nthan any other method currently available in astronomy. \n\n\n\n4.3 Timing binary pulsars\nThe presence of a companion to a pulsar affects the arrival time of\nthe pulses at Earth. This is (apart from additional relativistic corrections\nto be discussed later) due to the binary motion of the pulsar illustrated\nin Figure 5 and described by the 5 Keplerian parameters: orbital period;\nprojected semi-major axis of the orbit; eccentricity; and longitude and\nepoch of periastron. \nThese Keplerian parameters can be derived with pulsar timing in a similar\nway as is done for spectroscopic binaries in the optical regime. Figure\n6 shows, for instance, the variation of the 570-ms pulse period as measured\nfor the recently discovered PSR J1740-3052, which has the heaviest companion\nof any known pulsar in a 230-day orbit. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5. Binary parameters. Observer views\nfrom below.\n\n\nFigure 6. Variation of pulse period for pulsar\nPSR J1740-3052 due to binary motion. The dots are observed data and the\nline is the best-fit model.\n\n\n\n\nThe companion mass can be estimated from the mass function which is\nderived from Kepler's 3rd law and combines the observed Keplerian parameters\nwith the pulsar and companion mass. Using G as the gravitational constant,\nap  as the projected semi-major\naxis of the orbit, Pb as the orbital period and mp\nand mc as the mass of the pulsar and its companion, the mass\nfunction f is computed as: \n\n\n\nThe left hand side consists of observable parameters, which can be related\nto the masses on the right hand side.The inclination angle of the orbit,\ni, is in principle unknown, but by assuming an inclination of 90 deg, one\ncan at least derive a lower limit on the companion mass. In the\ncase of PSR J1740-3052, this is an amazing 11 solar masses. The nature\nof the companion is still unclear, and it has been speculated as to whether\nthis system could be the first pulsar-black hole binary system discovered. \nThe Keplerian parameters would describe the binary motion completely,\nif Newtonian physics were the correct theory of gravity. Albert Einstein\nhas demonstrated that this is not the case, when he introduced general\nrelativity. If general relativity, or any other theory of gravity deviating\nfrom Newtonian physics for that matter, is correct, we need additional\nparameters to describe the relativistic corrections needed to be made to\nthe Keplerian motion. These \"post-Keplerian\" parameters can also be determined\nby pulsar timing and can then be compared to predictions by general relativity\nor any other theory. The next section discusses how pulsars are the best\ntools to perform these relativistic tests. \n\n\n", "url": "http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/distance/frontiers/pulsars/section4.html", "hostname": "www.jb.man.ac.uk", "category": "uncategorized", "item_id": 19250525, "item_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19250525", "root_id": 19248790, "original_title": null}, {"title": "Einstein's Relativity and Everyday Life", "description": "Einstein's Relativity and Everyday Life", "url": "http://physicscentral.com/explore/writers/will.cfm", "hostname": "physicscentral.com", "category": "uncategorized", "item_id": 19249289, "item_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19249289", "root_id": 19248790, "original_title": null}, {"title": "Time dilation between Mars and Earth due to different mass", "description": "I am not sure I understand the Time dilation correctly but if mass has dirrect impact on time...than lets consider cosmological event - one orbit of planet Earth around Sun.

There are three subtypes which affect multiple organs to varying degrees, but the fundamental abnormalities involve the cerebellum[1] which controls muscle coordination. The adjacent third and fourth ventricles are often affected, which can alter the flow of cerebrospinal fluid, increase intracranial pressure, and lead to multiple other brain function problems. The degree of disability varies but is typically lifelong. Treatment may involve physical therapy, special education, or surgical placement of a cerebral shunt. It is named for Walter Dandy and Arthur Earl Walker.[2][3] In the majority of individuals with Dandy–Walker malformation, signs and symptoms caused by abnormal brain development are present at birth or develop within the first year of life. Some children have a buildup of fluid in the brain (hydrocephalus) that may cause increased head size (macrocephaly). Up to half of affected individuals have intellectual disability that ranges from mild to severe, and those with normal intelligence may have learning disabilities. Children with Dandy–Walker malformation often have delayed development, particularly a delay in motor skills such as crawling, walking, and coordinating movements. People with Dandy–Walker malformation may experience muscle stiffness and partial paralysis of the lower limbs (spastic paraplegia), and they may also have seizures. While rare, hearing and vision problems can be features of this condition.\n", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dandy%E2%80%93Walker_syndrome", "hostname": "en.wikipedia.org", "category": "wiki_article", "item_id": 19250400, "item_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19250400", "root_id": 19247664, "original_title": null}, {"title": "Research on meditation - Wikipedia", "description": "For the purpose of this article, research on meditation concerns research into the psychological and physiological effects of meditation using the scientific method.

Hamming codes are perfect codes, that is, they achieve the highest possible rate for codes with their block length and minimum distance of three.[1]\nRichard W. Hamming invented Hamming codes in 1950 as a way of automatically correcting errors introduced by punched card readers. In his original paper, Hamming elaborated his general idea, but specifically focused on the Hamming(7,4) code which adds three parity bits to four bits of data.[2]\n", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_code", "hostname": "en.wikipedia.org", "category": "wiki_article", "item_id": 19248788, "item_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19248788", "root_id": 19247633, "original_title": null}, {"title": "Adaptive Multi-Rate audio codec - Wikipedia", "description": "The Adaptive Multi-Rate (AMR, AMR-NB or GSM-AMR) audio codec is an audio compression format optimized for speech coding.

The American mathematician Richard Hamming pioneered this field in the 1940s and invented the first error-correcting code in 1950: the Hamming (7,4) code.[2]\nThe redundancy allows the receiver to detect a limited number of errors that may occur anywhere in the message, and often to correct these errors without retransmission. ECC gives the receiver the ability to correct errors without needing a reverse channel to request retransmission of data, but at the cost of a fixed, higher forward channel bandwidth. ECC is therefore applied in situations where retransmissions are costly or impossible, such as one-way communication links and when transmitting  to multiple receivers in multicast. For example, in the case of a satellite orbiting around Uranus, a retransmission because of decoding errors can create a delay of 5 hours. ECC information is usually added to mass storage devices to enable recovery of corrupted data, is widely used in modems, and is used on systems where the primary memory is ECC memory.\n", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_correction_code", "hostname": "en.wikipedia.org", "category": "wiki_article", "item_id": 19248788, "item_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19248788", "root_id": 19247633, "original_title": null}, {"title": "Clock recovery - Wikipedia", "description": "In serial communication of digital data, clock recovery is the process of extracting timing information from a serial data stream to allow the receiving circuit to decode the transmitted symbols.

The high communication overhead is one of the major\nperformance bottlenecks for distributed DNN training across multiple GPUs. Our\ninvestigations have shown that popular open-source DNN systems could only\nachieve 2.5 speedup ratio on 64 GPUs connected by 56 Gbps network. To address\nthis problem, we propose a communication backend named GradientFlow for\ndistributed DNN training, and employ a set of network optimization techniques.\nFirst, we integrate ring-based allreduce, mixed-precision training, and\ncomputation/communication overlap into GradientFlow. Second, we propose lazy\nallreduce to improve network throughput by fusing multiple communication\noperations into a single one, and design coarse-grained sparse communication to\nreduce network traffic by only transmitting important gradient chunks. When\ntraining ImageNet/AlexNet on 512 GPUs, our approach achieves 410.2 speedup\nratio and completes 95-epoch training in 1.5 minutes, which outperforms\nexisting approaches.", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.06855", "hostname": "arxiv.org", "category": "uncategorized", "item_id": 19247515, "item_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19247515", "root_id": null, "original_title": "GradientFlow: Training ImageNet in 1.5 Minutes on 512 GPUs"}, {"title": "Image Classification at Supercomputer Scale", "description": "Deep learning is extremely computationally intensive, and hardware vendors\nhave responded by building faster accelerators in large clusters.
