In this groundbreaking book, Nancy Leveson proposes a new approach to safety‚Äîmore suited to today's complex, sociotechnical, software-intensive world‚Äîbased on modern systems thinking and systems theory. Revisiting and updating ideas pioneered by 1950s aerospace engineers in their System Safety concept, and testing her new model extensively on real-world examples, Leveson has created a new approach to safety that is more effective, less expensive, and easier to use than current techniques.Arguing that traditional models of causality are inadequate, Leveson presents a new, extended model of causation (Systems-Theoretic Accident Model and Processes, or STAMP), then shows how the new model can be used to create techniques for system safety engineering, including accident analysis, hazard analysis, system design, safety in operations, and management of safety-critical systems. She applies the new techniques to real-world events including the friendly-fire loss of a U.S. Blackhawk helicopter in the first Gulf War; the Vioxx recall; the U.S. Navy SUBSAFE program; and the bacterial contamination of a public water supply in a Canadian town.

It was initially recognized as a clinical \"wasting\" syndrome and then in 1978, it was identified more specifically as a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE). Since then, CWD has spread to free-ranging and captive animal populations in 26 US states and three Canadian provinces.[3] CWD is typified by chronic weight loss leading to death.

Bouncer doesn't have the internet permission so even if it could get sensitive info (which it can't) it couldn't transmit it anywhere.

The algebra can be used to write expressions that are computationally equivalent to any Turing machine and as such, can be leveraged as the theoretical foundation for all stream-based processing languages and systems.", "url": "https://zenodo.org/record/2565243#.XHGlbrqYWc0", "hostname": "zenodo.org", "category": "uncategorized", "comment_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19235158"}, {"title": "Common LISP.
