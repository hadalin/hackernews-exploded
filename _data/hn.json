It more than likely contains errors (hopefully not serious ones). Furthermore, its references to the literature are incomplete.  Your comments and suggestions to the author at \ndimitrib@mit.edu \nare welcome. \n\n The purpose of the book is to consider large and challenging multistage decision problems, which can be solved in principle by dynamic programming and optimal control, but their exact solution is computationally intractable. We discuss solution methods that rely on approximations to produce suboptimal policies with adequate performance. \nThese methods are collectively referred to as reinforcement learning, and also by alternative names such as approximate dynamic programming, and neuro-dynamic programming. \n\n Our subject has benefited enormously from the interplay of ideas from optimal control and from artificial intelligence. One of the aims of this monograph is to explore the common boundary between these  two fields and to form a bridge that is accessible by workers with background in either field.\n\n The mathematical style of the book is somewhat different from the author's dynamic programming books, and the neuro-dynamic programming monograph, written jointly with John Tsitsiklis. We rely more on intuitive explanations and less on proof-based insights. Still we provide a rigorous short account of the theory of finite and infinite horizon dynamic programming, and some basic approximation methods, in an appendix. For this we require a modest mathematical background: calculus, elementary probability, and a minimal use of matrix-vector algebra.\n\nThe methods of this book have been successful in practice, and often spectacularly so, as evidenced by recent amazing accomplishments in the games of chess and Go. However, across a wide range of problems, their performance properties may be less than solid. This is a reflection of the state of the art in the field: there are no methods that are guaranteed to work for all or even most problems, but there are enough methods to try on a given challenging problem with a reasonable chance that one or more of them will be successful in the end.\nAccordingly, we have aimed to present a broad range of methods that are based on sound principles, and to provide intuition into their properties, even when these properties do not include a solid performance guarantee. Hopefully, with enough  exploration with some of these methods and their variations, the reader will be able to address adequately his/her own  problem.\n\n \n BOOK PREFACE, CONTENTS, AND CHAPTERS\n \nClick here for preface and table of contents.\n Drafts of book chapters (periodically updated, check for latest versions):  \nChapter 1: Exact Dynamic Programming, \nChapter 2: Approximation in Value Space,\nChapter 3: Parametric Approximation, \nChapter 4: Infinite Horizon Reinforcement Learning,\nChapter 5: Aggregation,\nReferences.\n\n \nClick here for a slide overview presentation from Conference on Decision and Control, Dec. 2018.\n\n\n\n\n REINFORCEMENT LEARNING COURSE AT ASU: SLIDES AND VIDEO LECTURES\n Lecture slides for a course in Reinforcement Learning and Optimal Control (January 8-February 21, 2019), at Arizona State University: \n Slides-Lecture 1, Slides-Lecture 2, Slides-Lecture 3, Slides-Lecture 4, Slides-Lecture 5, Slides-Lecture 6, Slides-Lecture 7, Slides-Lecture 8, \nSlides-Lecture 9, \nSlides-Lecture 10, \nSlides-Lecture 11, \nSlides-Lecture 12, \nSlides-Lecture 13.\n\n Videos of lectures from Reinforcement Learning and Optimal Control course at Arizona State University: (Clisk around the screen to see JUST THE VIDEO, or JUST THE SLIDES, or BOTH SIMULTANEOUSLY).\n Video-Lecture 1, \nVideo-Lecture 2, Video-Lecture 3,Video-Lecture 4,\nVideo-Lecture 5,\nVideo-Lecture 6,\nVideo-Lecture 7,\nVideo-Lecture 8,\nVideo-Lecture 9,\nVideo-Lecture 10,\nVideo-Lecture 11,\nVideo-Lecture 12,\nVideo-Lecture 13.\n\n Lecture 13 is an overview of the entire course.\n\n \n\n\n Dynamic Programming and Optimal Control, Vol. 1, 4th Edition\n Dimitri P. \nBertsekas\n Published February 2017\n\n\n The fourth edition (February 2017) contains a\nsubstantial amount of new material, particularly on approximate DP in Chapter 6. This chapter was thoroughly reorganized and rewritten, to bring it in line, both with the contents of Vol. II, whose latest edition appeared in 2012, and with recent developments, which have propelled approximate DP to the forefront of attention. \n\n Some of the highlights of the revision of Chapter 6 are an increased emphasis on one-step and multistep lookahead methods, parametric approximation architectures, neural networks, rollout, and Monte Carlo tree search. Among other applications, these methods have been instrumental in the recent spectacular success of computer Go programs. The material on approximate DP also provides an introduction and some perspective for the more analytically oriented treatment of Vol. II. \n\n Click here for direct ordering from the publisher and  preface, table of contents, supplementary educational material, lecture slides, videos, etc\n\nDynamic Programming and Optimal Control, Vol. I, ISBN-13: 978-1-886529-43-4, 576 pp., hardcover, 2017\n\n\n\n\n Dynamic Programming and Optimal Control, Vol. II, 4th Edition: Approximate Dynamic Programming\n Dimitri P. \nBertsekas\n Published June 2012\n\n\n \nThe fourth edition of Vol. II of the two-volume DP textbook was published in June 2012. This is a major revision of Vol. II and contains a substantial amount of new material, as well as \na reorganization of old material. The length has increased by more than 60% from the third edition, and\nmost of the old material has been restructured and/or revised. Volume II  now numbers more than 700 pages and is larger in size than Vol. I. It can arguably be viewed as a new book! \n\n \nApproximate DP has become the central focal point of this volume, and occupies more than half of the book (the last two chapters, and large parts of Chapters 1-3). Thus one may also view this new edition as a followup of the author's 1996 book \"Neuro-Dynamic Programming\" (coauthored with John Tsitsiklis). A lot of new  material, the outgrowth of research  conducted in the six years since the previous edition, has been included. \n\n A new printing of the fourth edition (January 2018) contains some updated material, particularly on undiscounted problems in Chapter 4, and approximate DP in Chapter 6. References were also made to the contents of the 2017 edition of Vol. I, and to high profile developments in deep reinforcement learning, which have brought approximate DP to the forefront of attention. \n\n\nDynamic Programming and Optimal Control, Vol. II: Approximate Dynamic Programming, ISBN-13: 978-1-886529-44-1, 712 pp., hardcover, 2012\n\n\n \n CHAPTER UPDATE - NEW MATERIAL\n Click here for an updated version of Chapter 4, which incorporates recent research on a variety of undiscounted problem topics, including\n\n\nDeterministic optimal control and adaptive DP (Sections 4.2 and 4.3).\n \n\n Stochastic shortest path problems under weak conditions and their relation to positive cost problems (Sections 4.1.4 and 4.4).\n  \n\nAffine monotonic and multiplicative cost models (Section 4.5).\n\n\n\n PREFACE, SLIDES, AND OTHER INFORMATION\n \nClick here for preface and detailed information.\n \nClick here to order at Amazon.com\n\n\nLectures on Exact and Approximate Finite Horizon DP:", "url": "http://web.mit.edu/dimitrib/www/RLbook.html", "hostname": "web.mit.edu", "category": "uncategorized", "comment_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19235028"}, {"title": "CS 294-112", "description": "CS 294-112 at UC Berkeley", "url": "http://rail.eecs.berkeley.edu/deeprlcourse/", "hostname": "rail.eecs.berkeley.edu", "category": "uncategorized", "comment_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19235767"}, {"title": "\r\n\t\t\tCOMPGI22 - Advanced Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning\r\n\t\t", "description": "This database contains 2017-18 versions of the syllabuses.

While a contract with the CIA kept them afloat, the company's big break came with the first invasion of Iraq; CNN used their technology to cover the war and made it famous. Then Google came on the scene, buying the company and relaunching the software as Google Maps and Google Earth. Eventually, Hanke's original company was spun back out of Google, and is now responsible for Pokemon GO.Kilday, the marketing director for Keyhole and Google Maps, was there from the earliest days, and offers a personal look behind the scenes at the tech and the minds developing it. But this book isn't only a look back at the past; it is also a glimpse of what's to come. Kilday reveals how emerging technologies including virtual reality and driverless cars are going to upend our lives once again.Never Lost Again is a tech insider's look at how our worldview changed dramatically as a result of vision, imagination, and implementation.
