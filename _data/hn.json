So it languished for more than six months, until an engineer, who saw that the cost of writing the code for it would be small, launched a simple online controlled experiment—an A/B test—to assess its impact. Within hours the new headline variation was producing abnormally high revenue, triggering a “too good to be true” alert. Usually, such alerts signal a bug, but not in this case. An analysis showed that the change had increased revenue by an astonishing 12%—which on an annual basis would come to more than $100 million in the United States alone—without hurting key user-experience metrics.

While a contract with the CIA kept them afloat, the company's big break came with the first invasion of Iraq; CNN used their technology to cover the war and made it famous. Then Google came on the scene, buying the company and relaunching the software as Google Maps and Google Earth. Eventually, Hanke's original company was spun back out of Google, and is now responsible for Pokemon GO.Kilday, the marketing director for Keyhole and Google Maps, was there from the earliest days, and offers a personal look behind the scenes at the tech and the minds developing it. But this book isn't only a look back at the past; it is also a glimpse of what's to come. Kilday reveals how emerging technologies including virtual reality and driverless cars are going to upend our lives once again.Never Lost Again is a tech insider's look at how our worldview changed dramatically as a result of vision, imagination, and implementation.

This work ties the source of the plasma to microwave photonic hotspots at the junction of aqueous dielectric spherical dimers. We use a combination of thermal-imaging techniques and computer simulations to show that grape-sized fruit and hydrogel beads form resonant cavities that concentrate electromagnetic fields to extreme subwavelength regions. This is enabled by the large dielectric susceptibility of water at microwave frequencies. Furthermore, the absorptive properties of water are key to washing out complex internal modes and for allowing the evanescent hotspot build-up. Our approach to microwave resonances in high-dielectric materials opens a sandbox for nanocluster photonics research.\n\nThe sparking of cut grape hemispheres in a household microwave oven has been a poorly explained Internet parlor trick for over two decades. By expanding this phenomenon to whole spherical dimers of various grape-sized fruit and hydrogel water beads, we demonstrate that the formation of plasma is due to electromagnetic hotspots arising from the cooperative interaction of Mie resonances in the individual spheres. The large dielectric constant of water at the relevant gigahertz frequencies can be used to form systems that mimic surface plasmon resonances that are typically reserved for nanoscale metallic objects. The absorptive properties of water furthermore act to homogenize higher-mode profiles and to preferentially select evanescent field concentrations such as the axial hotspot. Thus, beyond providing an explanation for a popular-science phenomenon, we outline a method to experimentally model subwavelength field patterns using thermal imaging in macroscopic dielectric systems.", "url": "https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2019/02/13/1818350116", "hostname": "www.pnas.org", "category": "uncategorized", "comment_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19234260"}, {"title": "How Microwaving Grapes Makes Plasma", "description": "A bisected grape in the microwave makes plasma.
