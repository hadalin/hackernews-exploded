In this\npaper, we study the task of reconstructing a facial image of a person from a\nshort audio recording of that person speaking. We design and train a deep\nneural network to perform this task using millions of natural Internet/YouTube\nvideos of people speaking. During training, our model learns voice-face\ncorrelations that allow it to produce images that capture various phys...", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09773", "hostname": "arxiv.org", "category": "uncategorized", "item_id": 20016177, "item_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20016177", "root_id": null, "original_title": "Speech2Face: Learning the Face Behind a Voice"}, {"title": "Blindpad", "description": "Open-source tools to reduce bias in technical communication. - Blindpad", "url": "https://github.com/blindpad", "hostname": "github.com", "category": "uncategorized", "item_id": 20019634, "item_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20019634", "root_id": 20016177, "original_title": null}, {"title": "Is This Playstation Game Racist?", "description": "A learn english game for Asian people with some subtle stereotypes involved... -", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72n34fRkA3I", "hostname": "www.youtube.com", "category": "video", "item_id": 20016874, "item_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20016874", "root_id": 20016177, "original_title": null}, {"title": "Gattaca - Wikipedia", "description": "Gattaca is a 1997 American science fiction film written and directed by Andrew Niccol.
