I hope this article\nwill convince people that Tcl is not that bad.\n\nPrologue\n\nIn my programming life I have used a lot of languages to write different\nkind of applications: many free/paywork programs in C, a web CMS\nin Scheme, a number of networking/web applications in Tcl, a shop\nmanagement system in Python, and so on. I used to play with a number\nof other programming languages like Smalltalk, Self, FORTH, Ruby, Joy,...\nAnd yet, I have no doubt, that there is no language that is as misunderstood\nin the programming community as Tcl is.\nTcl is not without faults, but most of its limitations are not\nhard coded in the language design, they are just the result of the\nfact that Tcl lost its \"father\" (John Ousterhout) a number of years ago, and together with him any kind\nof single-minded strong leadership that was able to take strong\ndecisions. With the right changes it is possible\nto overcome most of the limitations of Tcl, and at the same\ntime preserve the power of the language. If you don't trust Tcl is remarkably\npowerful please take the time to read this article first. Maybe\nyou still won't like it afterwards, but hopefully you will respect it, and you will certainly  have strong arguments against\nthe Tcl is a toy language misconception that's even more petty than\nLisp has too many parenthesis.\n\nBefore we begin, I'll spend some time explaining\nhow Tcl works. Like the best languages in the world, Tcl has a few\nconcepts that, combined together, allow for programming freedom\nand expressiveness.\nAfter this short introduction to Tcl, you'll see how in Tcl\nthings very similar to Lisp macros just happen using normal\nprocedures (in a much more powerful way than Ruby blocks),\nhow it's possible to redefine almost every part of the language\nitself, and how it is possible to mostly ignore\ntypes when programming. The Tcl community developed\na number of OOP systems, radical language modifications, macro\nsystems, and many other interesting things, just writing Tcl\nprograms. If you like programmable programming languages I bet\nyou'll at least look on it with interest.\n\nTcl in five minutes\nConcept 1: Programs are composed of commands\n\nThe first idea of the Tcl language is: commands.\nPrograms are commands, one after the other. For\nexample to set the variable 'a' to 5 and print its value\nyou write two commands:\n\nset a 5\nputs $a\n\n\nCommands are space separated words.\nA command ends with a newline or with a ; character.\nEverything is a command in Tcl - as you can see there\nis no assignment operator.  To set a variable you need a command,\nthe set command, that sets the variable specified as the\nfirst argument to the value specified as the second argument.\n\nAlmost every Tcl command returns a value, For example the set\ncommand returns the value assigned to the variable. If the\nset command is called with just one argument (the variable\nname), the current value of the variable is returned.\nConcept 2: Command substitution\n\nThe second idea is command substitution. In a command some arguments\nmay appear between [ and ] braces. If so\nthe argument is substituted with the return value of the code\nincluded inside the braces. For example:\n\nset a 5\nputs [set a]\n\n\nThe first argument of the second command, [set a], will be\nsubstituted with the return value of \"set a\" (that's 5).\nAfter the substitution step the command will be converted from:\n\nputs [set a]\n\nto\n\nputs 5\n\nAnd, at that point, it will be executed.\nConcept 3: Variable substitution\n\nAlways using the set command for variable substitution\nwould be too verbose, so even if not strictly needed, variable substitution\nwas introduced at some time during the early development of Tcl.\nIf a variable name is preceded by the $ character\nit is substituted with its value. So instead of\n\nputs [set a]\n\nit's possible to write\n\nputs $a\n\nConcept 4: Grouping\n\nIf commands are space separated words, how to deal with the\nneed for arguments that may contain spaces? For example:\n\nputs Hello World\n\n\nis an incorrect program as Hello and World are two different\narguments. This problem is solved by grouping. Text inside \"\"\nis considered a single argument, so the right program is:\n\nputs \"Hello World\"\n\n\nCommands and variables substitution work inside this kind\nof grouping, For example I can write:\n\nset a 5\nset b foobar\nputs \"Hello $a World [string length $b]\"\n\n\nAnd the result will be \"Hello 5 World 6\". Also, escapes\nlike \\t, \\n will do what you think.   There is, however, another kind\nof grouping where every kind of special character is just\nconsidered verbatim without any kind of substitution step.\nEverything between { and } is seen by Tcl as a unique argument\nwhere no substitutions are performed. So:\n\nset a 5\nputs {Hello $a World}\n\n\nWill print Hello $a World.\nConcept 1 again: Everything is a command\n\nConcept 1 was: programs are composed of commands. Actually it\nis much more true than you may think. For example in the program:\n\nset a 5\nif $a {\n    puts Hello!\n}\n\n\nif is a command, with two arguments. The first is the value\nof the variable a substituted, the second is the string { ... puts Hello! ... }.\nThe if command uses a special version of Eval\nthat we'll see in a moment to run the script passed as the second\nargument, and returns the result. Of course, you can write\nyour version of if or any other control structure if\nyou want. You may even redefine if itself and add some\nfeature to it!\nConcept 5: Everything is a string - no types\nThe following program works and does what you think:\n\nset a pu\nset b ts\n$a$b \"Hello World\"\n\n\nYes, in Tcl everything happens at runtime and is dynamic: it's\nthe ultimate late binding programming language, and there are no\ntypes. The command name is not a special type but just a string.\nNumbers are also just strings, so is Tcl code, a string (remember\nwe passed a string to the if command as second argument?).\nIn Tcl what a string represents is up to the command that's manipulating\nit. the string \"5\" will be seen as a string of characters by\nthe \"string length 5\" command, and as a boolean value by \"if $a ...\"\ncommand. Of course commands check that values have a suitable\nform, If I try to add \"foo\" to \"bar\" Tcl will produce an exception\nbecause it can't parse \"foo\" nor \"bar\" as numbers. This kind\nof checks in Tcl are very strict, so you'll not get the PHP-alike\neffect of silent absurd type conversions. The type conversion only\nhappens if the string makes sense interpreted as the thing the command\nneeds as arguments.\n\n\nSo Tcl is so dynamic, but guess what? It is more or less as fast as current\nRuby implementations. There is a trick in the implementation of\nTcl: objects (not in the OOP sense, but C structs representing\nTcl values) cache the native value of the last use of a given\nstring. If a Tcl value is always used as a number the C struct\nrepresenting it will contain an integer inside, and as long as\nthe next commands continue to use it as an integer, the string\nrepresentation of the object is not touched at all. It's a bit more complex\nthan this, but the result is that the programmer doesn't need to\nthink about types, and programs still work as fast as other\ndynamic programming languages where types are more explicit.\nConcept 6: Tcl lists\n\nOne of the more interesting types (or better.. string formats)\nTcl uses is lists. Lists are mostly the central structure\nof a Tcl program: a Tcl list is always a valid Tcl command!\n(and both are just strings, in the end).\nIn the simplest form lists are like commands: space separated\nwords. For example the string \"a b foo bar\" is a list with four elements.\nThere are commands to take a range of elements from a list,\nto add elements, and so on. Of course, lists may have elements\ncontaining spaces, so in order to create well formatted lists\nthe list command is used. Example:\n\nset l [list a b foo \"hello world\"]\nputs [llength $l]\n\n\nllength returns the length of the list, so the above\nprogram will print 4 as output. lindex will\ninstead return the element at the specified position,\nso \"lindex $l 2\" will return \"foo\", and so on.\nLike in Lisp, in Tcl most programmers use the list type\nto model as many concepts as possible in programs.\nConcept 7: Math in Tcl\n\nI bet most Lisp hackers already noted how Tcl is a prefix-notation\nlanguage, so you may think like in Lisp, math in Tcl is performed\nusing math operators as commands, like: puts [+ 1 2].\nInstead, things work in a different way: in order to make Tcl more\nfriendly there is a command taking infix math expressions as\nargument and evaluating them. This command is called expr, and\nmath in Tcl works like this:\n\nset a 10\nset b 20\nputs [expr $a+$b]\n\n\nCommands like if and while use expr\ninternally in order to evaluate expressions, for instance:\n\n\nwhile {$a < $b} {\n    puts Hello\n}\n\n\nwhere the while command takes two arguments - the first string being evaluated\nas an expression to check if it's true at every iteration,\nand the second evaluated itself each time.\nI think it's a design error that math commands are not builtins,\nI see expr like a cool tool to have where there is\ncomplex math to do, but to just add two numbers [+ $a $b]\nis more convenient.  It's worth noting that this has been formally\nproposed as a change to the language.\nConcept 8: Procedures\n\nNaturally, nothing stops a Tcl programmer from writing a procedure (that's\na user defined command) in order to use math operators as commands.\nLike this:\n\nproc + {a b} {\n    expr {$a+$b}\n}\n\n\nThe proc command is used to create a procedure: its first\nargument is the procedure name, the second is the list of arguments\nthe procedure takes as input, and finally the last argument\nis the body of the procedure. Note that the second argument,\nthe arguments list, is a Tcl list. As you can see the return\nvalue of the last command in a procedure is used as return\nvalue of the procedure (unless the return command is used\nexplicitly).\nBut wait... Everything is a command in Tcl right? So we can create\nthe procedures for +, -, *, ... in a simpler way instead of writing four\ndifferent procedures:\n\nset operators [list + - * /]\nforeach o $operators {\n    proc $o {a b} [list expr \"\\$a $o \\$b\"]\n}\n\n\nAfter this we can use [+ 1 2], [/ 10 2] and so on.\nOf course it's smarter to create these procedures as varargs\nlike Scheme's procedures. In Tcl procedures can have the same names\nas built in commands, so you can redefine Tcl itself. For example, in order\nto write a macro system for Tcl\nI redefined proc. Redefining proc is also useful\nfor writing profilers (Tcl profilers are developed in Tcl itself usually).\nAfter a built in command is redefined you can still call it if you\nrenamed it to some other name prior to overwriting it with proc.\nConcept 9: Eval and Uplevel\n\nIf you are reading this article you already know what Eval\nis. The command eval {puts hello} will of course evaluate the\ncode passed as argument, as happens in many other\nprogramming languages. In Tcl there is another beast,\na command called uplevel that can evaluate code in the\ncontext of the calling procedure, or for what it's worth, in\nthe context of the caller of the caller (or directly at the top level).\nWhat this means is that what in Lisp are macros, in Tcl are just\nsimple procedures. Example: in Tcl there is no \"built-in\"\nfor a command repeat to be used like this:\n\nrepeat 5 {\n    puts \"Hello five times\"\n}\n\nBut to write it is trivial.\n\nproc repeat {n body} {\n    set res \"\"\n    while {$n} {\n        incr n -1\n        set res [uplevel $body]\n    }\n    return $res\n}\n\n\nNote that we take care to save the result of the last\nevaluation, so our repeat will (like most Tcl\ncommands) return the last evaluated result.\nAn example of usage:\n\nset a 10\nrepeat 5 {incr a} ;# Repeat will return 15\n\n\nAs you can guess, the incr command is used to increment\nan integer var by one (if you omit its second argument).\n\"incr a\" is executed in the context of the calling procedure,\n(i.e. the previous stack frame).\nCongratulations, you know more than 90% of Tcl concepts!\nWhy is Tcl powerful?\n\nI am not going to show you every single Tcl feature, but I want to give an idea\nof advanced programming tasks that are solved in a very nice\nway with Tcl. I want to stress that I think Tcl has a number\nof faults, but most of them are not in the main ideas of\nthe language itself.  I think there is room for a Tcl-derived\nlanguage that can compete with Ruby, Lisp and Python today in interesting\ndomains like web programming, network programming, GUI development, DSL\nand as scripting language.\n\nSimple syntax that scales\nTcl syntax is so simple that you can write a parser for Tcl\nin few lines of code in Tcl itself. I wrote\na macro system for Tcl in Tcl\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    as I already mentioned, which is able to do source level transformations complex enough\nto allow tail call optimization.\nAt the same time, Tcl syntax is able to scale to appear more\nalgol-like, it depends on your programming style.\nNo types, but strict format checks\n\nThere are no types, and you don't need to perform conversions,\nhowever, you aren't likely to introduce bugs because the checks on the format\nof the strings are very strict. Even better, you don't need\nserialization. Have a big complex Tcl list and want to send\nit via a TCP socket? Just write: puts $socket $mylist.\nOn the other side of the socket read it as set mylist [read $socket].\nand you are done.\nPowerful, event driven I/O model\n\nTcl has built-in event-driven programming, integrated with the I/O library. To write complex networking programs with just what is provided in the core language is so simple it's funny. An example: the following program is\na concurrent (internally select(2) based) TCP server that outputs\nthe current time to every client.\n\nsocket -server handler 9999\nproc handler {fd clientaddr clientport} {\n    set t [clock format [clock seconds]]\n    puts $fd \"Hello $clientaddr:$clientport, current date is $t\"\n    close $fd\n}\nvwait forever\n\n\nNon-blocking I/O and events are handled so well that you can even\nwrite to a socket where there is no longer output buffer and Tcl\nwill automatically buffer it in userland and send it in background to the socket\nwhen there is again space on the socket's output buffer.\n\nPython users know a good idea when they see it - Python's \"Twisted\"\nframework makes use of the same select-driven IO concepts that Tcl has\nhad natively for years.\nMultiple paradigms\n\nIn Tcl you can write object oriented code, functional style code,\nand imperative code in a mix, like it happens in Common Lisp more\nor less. A number of OOP systems and Functional Programming primitives\nwhere implemented in the past. There are everything from prototype-based\nOOP systems to SmallTalk-like ones, and many are implemented in Tcl\nitself (or were initially, as a proof-of-concept). Furthermore, because code in Tcl\nis first class, it is very simple to write functional language\nprimitives that play well with the logic of the language.\nAn example is lmap:\n\nlmap i {1 2 3 4 5} {\n    expr $i*$i\n}\n\n\nwhich will return a list of squares, 1 4 9 12 25. You can write\na map-like function based on a version of lamba\n(also developed in Tcl itself), but Tcl has already what you\nneed to allow for a more natural functional programming than\nthe Lisp way (which works well for Lisp but maybe not for everything\nelse).  Note what happens when you try to add functional programming\nto a language that's too rigid: Python and the endless debate of\nits functional primitives.\nCentral data structure: the list\n\nIf you are a Lisp programmer you know how beautiful is to\nhave a flexible data structure like the list everywhere in your\nprograms, especially when the literal is as simple as\n\"foo bar 3 4 5 6\" in most cases.\nProgrammable programming language via uplevel\n\nVia eval, uplevel, upvar and the very powerful introspection\ncapabilities of Tcl you can redefine the language and invent\nnew ways of solving problems. For example, the following interesting\ncommand if called as first command in a function will automagically\nmake it a memoizing version of the function:\n\nproc memoize {} {\n    set cmd [info level -1]\n    if {[info level] > 2 && [lindex [info level -2] 0] eq \"memoize\"} return\n    if {![info exists ::Memo($cmd)]} {set ::Memo($cmd) [eval $cmd]}\n    return -code return $::Memo($cmd)\n}\n\nThen, when you write a procedure just write something like:\n\nproc myMemoizingProcedure { ... } {\n    memoize\n    ... the rest of the code ...\n} \n\ni18n just happens\n\nTcl is probably the language with the best internationalization\nsupport. Every string is internally encoded in utf-8, all the\nstring operations are Unicode-safe, including the regular expression\nengine. Basically, in Tcl programs, encodings are not a problem -\nthey just work.\nRadical language modifications = DSL\n\nIf you define a procedure called unknown it is called\nwith a Tcl list representing arguments of every command Tcl tried\nto execute, but failed because the command name was not defined. You can do\nwhat you like with it, and return a value, or raise an error.\nIf you just return a value, the command will appear to work even\nif unknown to Tcl, and the return value returned by unknown\nwill be used as return value of the not defined command.\nAdd this to uplevel and upvar, and the language itself that's almost\nsyntax free, and what you get is an impressive environment for\nDomain Specific Languages development. Tcl has almost no syntax,\nlike Lisp and FORTH, but there are different ways to have no syntax.\nTcl looks like a configuration file by default:\n\ndisable ssl\nvalidUsers jim barbara carmelo\nhostname foobar {\n    allow from 2:00 to 8:00\n}\n\n\nThe above is a valid Tcl program, once you define the commands\nused, disable, validUsers and hostname.\nMuch more\n\nUnfortunately there isn't room to show a lot of interesting features:\nmost Tcl commands just do one single thing well with easy to remember names.\nStrings operations, introspection and other features\nare implemented as single commands with subcommands, for example\nstring length, string range and so on. Every part of\nthe language that gets indexes as argument support an end-num\nnotation, so for example to take all the elements of a list but\nnot the first nor the last you just write:\n\nlrange $mylist 1 end-1\n\n\nAnd in general there is a lot of good design and optimization\nfor the common case inside. Moreover the Tcl source code is one\nof the best written C programs you'll find, and the quality of\nthe interpreter is amazing: commercial grade in the best sense of the\nword. Another interesting thing about the implementation is that\nit works exactly the same in different environments, from Windows\nto Unix, to Mac OS X. No quality difference among different\noperating systems (yes, including Tk, the main GUI library of Tcl).\nConclusion\n\nI don't claim everybody should like Tcl. What I claim is that Tcl\nis a powerful language and not a Toy, and it's possible to create\na new Tcl-alike language without most of the limitations of Tcl\nbut with all of its power. I tried this myself, and\nthe Jim interpreter is the\nresult: the code is there and working and can run most Tcl\nprograms, but then I had no longer time to work for free to\nlanguage development, so the project is now more or less abandoned.\nAnother attempt to develop a Tcl-alike language,\nHecl, is currently\nin progress, as a scripting language for Java applications,\nwhere the author (David Welton) exploits the fact that the Tcl core\nimplementation is small, and the command based design simple to\nuse as a glue between the two languages (This is not typical with\nmodern dynamic languages, but both the ideas apply to Scheme too).\nI'll be very glad if, after reading this article, you no longer think of Tcl\nas a Toy.

SQLite is also an\nintegral part of most web browsers. SQLite is built into MacOS and\nis used by most of the default applications on that platform.\nWindows10 requires the C:\\Windows\\System32\\winsqlite3.dll file in\norder to boot. Countless other popular applications like Skype\nand WhatsApp and iTunes depend on SQLite.\n\nBecause SQLite is open source and can be freely downloaded and\nduplicated, exact usage numbers are unavailable. But reasonable\nestimates are that there are more SQLite instances in operation\ntoday than there are people on earth. Most devices that\nuse the SQLite database engine contain hundreds of separate databases,\nand there are billions of such devices. Hence, there are likely\naround one trillion SQLite databases in active use.\n\nThere are more copies of SQLite in use than there are copies of Linux.\nWe know this because SQLite is used on almost all Linux systems, but\nSQLite is also used on many other non-linux systems such as Macs, iPhones,\nand Windows computers.\nBy similar arguments, there are more copies of SQLite in use than\nthere are Macs, or Windows PCs.\nThere are probably more copies of SQLite in use than all other database\nengines combined.\nIt seems likely that SQLite is the most widely used and deployed\nsoftware component of any kind, with the possible exception of the\nzLib compression library.\n1.2 SQLite Is A TCL Extension, Not A TCL Application\n\nSQLite is not written in TCL. Rather, SQLite is intended to be used\nby TCL. Like the TCL interpreter, SQLite is written in ANSI C.\n\nThe fact that SQLite was primarily intended to be used from TCL\nis evident in an number of ways.\n\nAll programming languages, other than C/C++, require some kind of\nadaptor in order to interface with the SQLite C implementation. Language\nadaptors for SQLite are widely available from third party programmers.\nThe adaptors for PHP and Python are built into those languages, for\nexample. A Java adaptor is baked into Android. And so forth. Only\nthe TCL adaptor is included as part of the SQLite core. The source code\nfile that implements the TCL adaptor for SQLite, \"tclsqlite.c\",\nwas part of the very first check-in on the SQLite source repository\non 2000-05-29. (See\nhttps://sqlite.org/src/ci/6f3655f79f9b6fc9.)\n\nAll modern SQL implementations provide a means to do late binding of\nparameter values to the SQL statements. Usually a naked \"?\" character,\nor a \"?\" followed by an integer is used. For example:\nSELECT passwd, photo FROM user WHERE uid=?1\n\n\nThe \"?1\" token in the SQL above would be assigned a value at run-time\nin order to look up the password and photograph of a particular user.\n\nSQLite supports this syntax. But because of its TCL heritage, SQLite\nalso allows the parameter to take the form of a TCL variable. Hence:\nSELECT passwd, photo FROM user WHERE uid=$uid\n\n\nWhen a statement such as the above is run, the TCL language adaptor\nautomatically binds the value of the $uid TCL variable to the SQL statement\nbefore it is evaluated, providing an intuitive and seamless interface\nbetween TCL and SQL. SQLite is the only database engine that behaves\nthis way.\n\nThe TCL heritage of SQLite is visible in the type system of\nSQLite. Early versions of SQLite (prior to 2004) operated on the classic\nTCL principal that \"everything is a string\". Beginning with SQLite3\n(2004-06-18), SQLite also supports binary data. However, types are still\nvery flexible in SQLite, just as they are in TCL. SQLite treats the datatypes\non column names in a CREATE TABLE statement as suggestions rather than\nhard requirements. SQLite is happy to store a 100KB string value in a\ncolumn that is declared \"SHORT INT\", just as TCL is happy to store either\na large string or a small integer in the same variable. There are some\ndifferences in how SQLite deals with datatypes, in comparison to TCL, due\nto the different nature of the SQL language. SQLite has the concept of\n\"type affinity\". If a column is declared \"INT\" and one inserts a string\ninto that column that looks like an integer and can be safely converted into\nan integer without loss of information, then that conversion occurs\nautomatically. This provides a measure of compatibility with the rigid\ntype systems of other SQL database engines.\n\nThe flexible type system of SQLite seems natural and intuitive to programmers\nwith prior experience programming in TCL. Curiously, though, it is a source\nof frustration and frequent complaining from programmers accustomed to the\nrigid and unforgiving type systems of languages like Java.\n\nThe similarities in the type systems of TCL and SQLite extends to more than\njust the interface. An important part of the C/C++ interface for SQLite\nis the \"sqlite3_value\" object\n(https://sqlite.org/c3ref/value.html) which is analogous to the\nTcl_Obj object in TCL. Both TCL and SQLite use a dual-representation approach,\nwhere each value can be represented simultaneously as both a string and\nsome other type.\n2.0 How SQLite Depends On Tcl\n\nSQLite began as a TCL extension, though these days most uses of SQLite\nare in applications written in languages other than TCL. Many programmers\nwho use SQLite in their applications have no knowledge or awareness of TCL.\nThe SQLite source code used by most developers is a single file of pure\nC code named \"sqlite3.c\" that contains no TCL code.\nThis is what we mean when we\nsay that SQLite as \"escaped\" into the wild. Deployed instances of SQLite\nno longer depends on TCL.\n\nNevertheless, SQLite is still heavily dependent upon TCL and the ongoing\nsupport, maintenance, and enhancement of SQLite would not be possible without\nTCL, and would be seriously inconvenienced without Tk.\n2.1 SQLite Source Code Is Mostly TCL\n\nThe deliverable source code for SQLite is a single file named\n\"sqlite3.c\" and its companion header \"sqlite3.h\".\nBoth files are 100% ANSI-C code. But developers do not edit these\nfiles directly. The sqlite3.c and sqlite3.h source files are build\nproducts, and the source tree used to build those files is over 50%\nTCL code. Figure 1 nearby shows the exact ratios.\n\n\nFigure 1: Breakdown Of SQLite Source Code By Language\n\n\nFigure 1 is for the main SQLite source repository. Many of the test\ncases and much of the documentation is held in separate repositories,\nnot included in Figure 1. The separate repositories also contain a great\ndeal of TCL code.\n\nMuch of the TCL code in the main SQLite repository consists of test scripts.\nAt this writing, the core repository contains 1153 separate test scripts\ntotally about 389 KB of space.\nBut this is not the only use of TCL in SQLite.\n2.2 Machine Generated C Code\n\nA non-trivial amount of the deliverable C code for SQLite is machine\ngenerated. Some of the machine generated code is created by C programs,\nsuch as LEMON which translates the SQL language grammar into C code to\nimplement a push-down automaton to parse the SQL language. But much of\nthe automatically generated code is created using TCL scripts. TCL is\nwell suited for scanning source files to extract information to be\nmerged with other files and for making mechanized edits. For example,\nthe byte-code engine used to evaluate SQL statements inside of SQLite\nis implemented as a large \"switch\" statement inside a \"for\" loop, with a\nseparate \"case\" for each opcode, all in the \"vdbe.c\" source file.\nAt build-time, TCL scripts scan the vdbe.c source file looking for the\nappropriate \"case\" statements and then build header files that assign\nconsecutive integers to each symbolic opcode name. (The opcodes used by\nthe SQLite byte-code engine are not an API as they are in TCL and thus\ncan change from one build to the next.) This mapping of symbolic opcode\nnames into integers is not a simple as one might suppose. For reasons\nof optimization, there are many constraints on the specific values that\nare assigned to opcodes. For example, many opcodes such as OP_Add must\nhave the same numeric value as the corresponding \"+\" token in the SQL\nlanguage parser. Sometimes a group of related opcodes, such as the\ncomparison operators OP_Eq, OP_Ne, OP_Lt, OP_Le, OP_Ge, and OP_Gt, need\nto be assigned consecutive integers in a specific order. These constraints\nare all handled effortlessly in TCL. Accomplishing the\nsame with AWK would be rather more difficult.\n\nPerhaps the most important task for TCL during the SQLite build process\nis constructing the SQLite amalgamation source code file.\nRecall that most developers use SQLite in the form of a single big file\nof C code named \"sqlite3.c\" and referred to as \"the amalgamation\".\nA TCL script named \"mksqlite3c.tcl\" runs in order to construct the\namalgamation from over one hundred separate input files. Each of these\ninputs files must be added to the amalgamation in just the right order.\nFurthermore, the source files are edited as part of the amalgamation building\nprocess. When mksqlite3c.tcl encounters a \"#include\" for an SQLite header,\nit replaces the \"#include\" with a copy of that header file, taking care\nto make sure each header file is only included once. The mksqlite3.tcl\nscript automatically adds the \"static\" keyword to internal SQLite APIs\nto give them file linkage, and makes other similar edits.\n2.3 The sqlite3_analyzer.exe Utility\n\nIn addition to the core SQLite library, the SQLite source tree also contains\ncode for several analysis and control programs. One of these programs\nis called \"sqlite3_analyzer\" (or \"sqlite3_analyzer.exe\" on Windows).\nThe sqlite3_analyzer program examines an SQLite database and generates\na detailed report on the disk usage by the various tables and indexes\nwithin that database. The sqlite3_analyzer program is very useful in\nunderstanding how an application is using disk space.\n\nIt turns out that sqlite3_analyzer, though disguised as an ordinary\nexecutable, is really a TCL application. The main source code file for\nthis application is\ntool/spaceanal.tcl.\nDuring the build process, this script is converted into a C-language\nstring constant (using another TCL script) and added to a very simple\nC-language wrapper than starts a TCL interpreter and then passes the\napplication script to that interpreter.\n\nThe sqlite3_analyzer program could be rewritten in pure C. But that\nwould be a lot of code. The TCL script that implements sqlite3_analyzer is\nless than 1000 lines long. The equivalent C program would surely be at\nleast ten times larger.\n\nNote that the sqlite3_analyzer utility program statically links a TCL\ninterpreter and so does not require a TCL installation on the target\ncomputer to use. The sqlite3_analyzer utility program is used by\ntens of thousands of developers, most of whom do not realize that they\nare really running a TCL application.\n2.4 TCL Used For Testing SQLite\n\nOne of the key features of SQLite is that it uses aviation-grade testing.\nThe tests of SQLite, at a minimum, provide 100% modified condition/decision\ncoverage (MC/DC) of the SQLite code, with independence. 100% MC/DC roughly\nmeans that every branch instruction at the machine code level is exercised\nat least once in each direction. The precise definition of\nMC/DC is slightly stricter than this, for example when comparing boolean\nvectors, but the 100% branch tests coverage definition is very close\napproximation. The \"with independence\" term means that SQLite is tested\nin multiple ways with test code being written and maintained by different\nindividuals.\n\nThe amount of testing done on SQLite is fanatical. On the other hand,\nthat level of testing is necessary for a fundamental low-level component,\nsuch as a database engine, that is used by billions of devices. If an\nordinary application encounters an obscure bug, it can normally be rebooted\nto clear the problem. But the job of a database engine is to remember things,\nand so databases tend to remember their mistakes across reboots. For these\nreasons, it is important that SQLite have a very low bug density.\n\nTCL is used in every aspect of SQLite testing.\nThe test cases that are part of the primary SQLite source code\nrepository are written in TCL.\nOther test cases such as\nTH3 and\nSQLLogicTest are written\nin C but still depend on TCL for operation.\n\nThe TH3 test suite is a set of proprietary tests for SQLite that form the\nprimary means of achieving 100% MC/DC. TH3 is designed to\nrun on embedded hardware without the support of a desktop operating system.\nTH3 consists of over 1350 test modules together with over 100 control files.\nThe test modules are written in either C or SQL or a combination of both.\nThe control files are text formatted in a way that easily parsed by TCL.\nTo build a TH3 test, a TCL script is run that combines some subset of the\ntest modules and control files into a single large C program that will\nautomatically run the required tests. This C program is then linked against\nthe \"sqlite3.c\" amalgamation and the resulting binary is moved to the target\ncomputer and executed. TCL scripts automate this entire process on\nall major host platforms.\n\nTo verify that the TH3 tests really do provide 100% MC/DC, special options\nare added to the TCL scripts that run the tests, causing the GCC coverage\nanalysis tools to be invoked. The output of gcov is then postprocessed to\nreveal and report any branch instructions that were missed by the tests.\nThe TH3 tests themselves are all implemented in C and SQL, but the operation\nand management of those tests is all done with TCL.\n2.5 TCL Generated Documentation\n\nThe extensive documentation for SQLite available on the SQLite website\n(https://sqlite.org/) is all generated\nby TCL. Many of the documents, such as the API reference documentation and\nthe descriptions of the byte-code engine opcodes, are created by TCL scripts\nthat scan C source code and extract the necessary information from the code\nand comments. Thus, the API documentation is largely derived from\ncomments in the source code. Keeping the official documentation (in\ncomments) and the source code close together helps ensure that they are\nin agreement.\n\nOther whitepaper documents are generated from source files that look\nmostly like\nHTML but which contain additional TCL code embedded inside of\n<tcl>...</tcl> markup. The added TCL code is used for\nadvanced formatting techniques, for automatically creating cross-references\nand cross-links, and for constructing complex displays such as the\npopular \"rail-road\" syntax diagrams for SQL.\n2.6 Tcl/Tk Used During Development Of SQLite\n\nThe text editor used by the primary author of SQLite is a custom editor\nwith emacs-style key bindings that is built on top of the Tk Text widget.\nThe \"e\" editor, as it is called, is cross-platform, which helps in the\ndevelopment of a cross-platform software library like SQLite. The \"e\"\neditor has been used for the entire 17-year history of SQLite. It has\nbeen enhanced over the years with various customizations created especially\nto help manage the SQLite source code.\n\nThe Fossil version control system used for the SQLite source code\n(and written specifically for that purpose) uses Tcl/Tk to show graphical\nside-by-side diffs in a separate window. When the \"fossil diff --tk\"\ncommand is run, Fossil generates a script to show the diff graphically\nand then kicks off a separate \"wish\" process to run that script and\ndisplay the diff in a separate window. This graphical diff window has\na \"Save\" button which will cause the Tcl/Tk code needed to reproduce itself\nto be written to a file. This file can be, in turn, sent to a collaborator\nfor display. Passing around graphical diffs as ordinary text files is\nmuch simpler and easier than passing around JPEG images or text \"context\"\ndiffs.\n\nNo two SQLite developers work in the same office. The team is\ngeographically distributed. To help the team stay in touch, a custom\nchatroom has been created using a Tcl/Tk script. The same script works\nas both client and server. The chatroom is private and uses a proprietary\nprotocol, so that developers are free to discuss sensitive matters without\nfear of eavesdropping. The chatroom is implemented as just over\n1000 lines of Tk code, and is thus accessible and easy to customize.\nAmong the customizations is the ability to send saved \"fossil diff --tk\"\ngraphical diffs to collaborators and have the diff pop automatically on\nthe collaborators screen. Small features like this seem trivial\nby themselves, but together than help the developers\nto work much more efficiently. These kinds of productivity-enhancing\nfeatures are unavailable to users of commercial business collaboration\npackages such as HipChat.\n3.0 Summary\n\nSQLite is an indispensable element of most modern computer systems, and\nTCL is an indispensable tool used in the production and maintenance of\nSQLite. Thus, the computing infrastructure we enjoy today would not exist\nexcept for TCL.\n\nAs deployed, SQLite contains no TCL code.\nHowever, the design of SQLite is inspired by TCL.\nAnd TCL is used extensively in the code generation, testing,\nanalysis, documentation, and development of SQLite. Without\nTCL, SQLite would not exist.\n\nEvery developer and every team has a finite number of \"brain cycles\"\navailable to do their job. The fewer cycles spent messing with tools,\nthe more cycles are available to devote towards solving the problem.\nSo for maximum productivity, it is important to use tools that get\nthe job done with a minimum of fuss and bother.\nOur 17-year experience using TCL in the SQLite project has convinced\nus that TCL is just such a tool. Tcl provides the most help per\nbrain cycle of any similar technology.\n", "url": "https://www.tcl.tk/community/tcl2017/assets/talk93/Paper.html", "hostname": "www.tcl.tk", "category": "uncategorized", "item_id": 19261007, "item_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19261007", "root_id": 19260306, "original_title": null}, {"title": "Mike Stonebraker calls for the complete destruction of the old DBMS order | DBMS 2 : DataBase Management System Services", "description": "Last week, Dan Weinreb tipped me off to something very cool: Mike Stonebraker and a group of MIT/Brown/Yale colleagues are calling for a complete rewrite of", "url": "https://www.dbms2.com/2008/02/18/mike-stonebraker-calls-for-the-complete-destruction-of-the-old-dbms-order/", "hostname": "www.dbms2.com", "category": "uncategorized", "item_id": 19261633, "item_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19261633", "root_id": 19260306, "original_title": null}, {"title": "Around 75% of Open Redis Servers Are Infected With Malware", "description": "The vast majority of Redis servers left open on the Internet without any authentication system in place are most likely harboring malware, an Imperva spokesperson said.", "url": "https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/around-75-percent-of-open-redis-servers-are-infected-with-malware/", "hostname": "www.bleepingcomputer.com", "category": "uncategorized", "item_id": 19260719, "item_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19260719", "root_id": 19260306, "original_title": null}, {"title": "\nA few things about Redis security - <antirez>\n", "description": null, "url": "http://antirez.com/news/96", "hostname": "antirez.com", "category": "uncategorized", "item_id": 19262284, "item_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19262284", "root_id": 19260306, "original_title": null}, {"title": "k3s - Lightweight Kubernetes | k3s", "description": "Join us on March 13, 2019 for an online meetup where we will demo k3s and answer your questions", "url": "https://k3s.io", "hostname": "k3s.io", "category": "site", "item_id": 19261324, "item_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19261324", "root_id": null, "original_title": "k3s – Lightweight Kubernetes"}, {"title": "FOSDEM 2019 - AMENDMENT CI/CD for embedded development with an ESP8266, Arduino-cli, Gitlab-ci, Raspberry Pi, and Kubernetes", "description": null, "url": "https://fosdem.org/2019/schedule/event/hw_gitlab_ci_arduino/", "hostname": "fosdem.org", "category": "uncategorized", "item_id": 19261916, "item_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19261916", "root_id": 19261324, "original_title": null}, {"title": "Introducing a Lightweight Kubernetes Distribution Built for the Edge", "description": "Kubernetes is pushing out of the data center into stores, networks and factories.
