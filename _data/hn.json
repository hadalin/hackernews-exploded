Content spinning works by replacing specific words, phrases, sentences, or even entire paragraphs with any number of alternate versions to provide a slightly different variation with each spin. This process can be completely automated or written manually as many times as needed. Early content produced through automated methods often resulted in articles which were hard or even impossible to read. However, as article spinning techniques were refined they became more sophisticated, and can now result in perfectly readable articles which appear original. Once considered spamdexing, a black hat SEO practice years ago, the practice is now admitted as a fair way to lower the similarity ratio, resulting large catalogs of more or less similar items. Website authors use article spinning to reduce the similarity ratio of rather redundant pages or pages with thin content, and to avoid penalties in the search engine results pages (SERPs) for using duplicate content. It is also used in other types of applications, such as message personalization and chatbots.\n", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_spinning", "hostname": "en.wikipedia.org", "category": "wiki_article", "item_id": 19253944, "item_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19253944", "root_id": 19253787, "original_title": null}, {"title": "Better Language Models and Their Implications", "description": "We’ve trained a large-scale unsupervised language model which generates coherent paragraphs of text, achieves state-of-the-art performance on many language modeling benchmarks, and performs rudimentary reading comprehension, machine translation, question answering, and summarization — all without task-specific training.

Since the last major release of MUMmer version 3 in 2004, it has been applied to many types of problems including aligning whole genome sequences, aligning reads to a reference genome, and comparing different assemblies of the same genome. Despite its broad utility, MUMmer3 has limitations that can make it difficult to use for large genomes and for the very large sequence data sets that are common today. In this paper we describe MUMmer4, a substantially improved version of MUMmer that addresses genome size constraints by changing the 32-bit suffix tree data structure at the core of MUMmer to a 48-bit suffix array, and that offers improved speed through parallel processing of input query sequences. With a theoretical limit on the input size of 141Tbp, MUMmer4 can now work with input sequences of any biologically realistic length. We show that as a result of these enhancements, the nucmer program in MUMmer4 is easily able to handle alignments of large genomes; we illustrate this with an alignment of the human and chimpanzee genomes, which allows us to compute that the two species are 98% identical across 96% of their length. With the enhancements described here, MUMmer4 can also be used to efficiently align reads to reference genomes, although it is less sensitive and accurate than the dedicated read aligners. The nucmer aligner in MUMmer4 can now be called from scripting languages such as Perl, Python and Ruby. These improvements make MUMer4 one the most versatile genome alignment packages available.", "url": "https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005944", "hostname": "journals.plos.org", "category": "uncategorized", "item_id": 19252704, "item_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19252704", "root_id": 19248723, "original_title": null}, {"title": "stretch / sync an SRT subtitle file to exactly match your video file.", "description": "stretch / sync an SRT subtitle file to exactly match your video file. - srt.tcl", "url": "https://gist.github.com/jgthms/7dfc20db3478a938069a0191c4e30843", "hostname": "gist.github.com", "category": "uncategorized", "item_id": 19252206, "item_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19252206", "root_id": 19248723, "original_title": null}, {"title": "Transcribe audio and video, edit by editing text - Descript", "description": "The fastest and easiest way for podcasters and audio producers to transcribe, edit, and collaborate.", "url": "https://www.descript.com", "hostname": "www.descript.com", "category": "site", "item_id": 19252330, "item_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19252330", "root_id": 19248723, "original_title": null}, {"title": "kaegi/aligner", "description": "Fully automatically corrects subtitle with a reference subtitle  - kaegi/aligner", "url": "https://github.com/kaegi/aligner", "hostname": "github.com", "category": "repository", "item_id": 19253180, "item_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19253180", "root_id": 19248723, "original_title": null}, {"title": "A simple python tool to fix time of srt files", "description": "A simple python tool to fix time of srt files.

By interacting with\nthe free electrons in the interstellar medium, pulses at lower frequencies\nare delayed. In other words, pulses emitted at higher frequencies arrive\nearlier than those emitted at lower frequencies. This effect is shown in\nFigure 1 which shows pulses at different, adjacent radio frequencies. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Real data showing the dispersion\neffect in the progressive delay of pulses to higher frequencies.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bottom of Figure 1 shows the pulse profile obtained after delaying\nthe high frequency pulses until the lowest frequency arrived before summing\nup all frequency channels. We call this process to correct for dispersion\n\"de-dispersion\". If the delay would not have been accounted for, the summed\npulse would have been blurred and smeared. If the delay is too big, the\npulses may become undetectable. The dispersion delay measured in milliseconds\nincreases at lower\nfrequencies as\n\n\nwhere the low and high\nare the lower and higher frequencies, respectively, measured in MHz. \nThe constant\nDM is called the \"dispersion measure\" and increases with distance and electron\ndensity between Earth and pulsar (see parts 4.4 and 4.5 below) and is measured in units of parsecs per cubic centimetre (a distance and an electron \ndensity as you shall see later). \nObservations are always made with a finite bandwidth, BW. The larger\nthe bandwidth, the more emission can be received, making the observations\nmore sensitive. Hence, one usually attempts to maximise the bandwidth.\nAt the same time, however, the dispersion smearing increases and the pulses\nobserved at a frequency   in MHz would be blurred by\n\nseconds per \nMHZ of bandwidth\nif no de-dispersion were done. The easiest way is usually to follow\nthe example of the above plot and to split the total bandwidth, BW, into\na number of smaller channels. The signals are then detected and delayed\nbefore summing as described above. Of course, there is still dispersion\nsmearing in each of the smaller channels, so that the channel width is\nchosen depending on observing frequency and aim of the observations. We\nwill review another de-dispersion method, which removes dispersion completely,\nbelow. \nThe sensitivity of the observation, or the \"signal-to-noise\" ratio describing\nthe strength of a signal compared to random noise, depends on more parameters\nthan just the bandwidth of the receiving system:\n\n\nThe size of the telescope matters, which is described by the \"gain\" parameter.\nThe larger the telescope, the larger the gain, G.\n\nEach piece of equipment involved produces a random thermal noise signal.\nThis is the reason why one tries to cool receivers to temperatures of only\na few degrees above absolute zero. Any remaining thermal noise signal is\ndescribed by the system noise temperature, Tsys.\n\nThermal noise is a random signal, while the pulsar signal arrives periodically\nwith the pulsar period. Averaging (\"integrating\") the received signals\nover a period of time, will therefore reduce the random noise relative\nto the real signal. Hence, the signal-to-noise ratio, \"SNR\" or \"S/N\", increases\nwith integration time, tint.\n\nA simple receiver system is only sensitive to one of two orthogonal polarisation\ndirections. One usually combines two such systems, to measure the intensity\nin both directions. Effectively, one then increases the used bandwidth\nby a factor equal to the number of received polarisations, Npol\n(max. 2).\n\nAll of the above considerations are combined in the equation displayed\nin Figure 2, where K is a constant of order unity and S the strength of\nthe pulsar. The diagram also summarises the typical situation during pulsar\nobservations. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Schematic of pulsar observing system.\nThe pulses emitted by the pulsar (upper right) propagate through the interstellar\nmedium (ISM), before being picked up by a telescope and the installed receiving\nsystem. In a standard approach the total bandwidth is split into smaller\nchannels by a filterbank (for each polarisation). The signals of each filterbank\nare acquired by a data acquisition system and recoded along with information\nfrom the observatory's atomic clock which is synchronised to an international\ntime standard with GPS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3. Illustration of the advantages of\ncoherent dedispersion in observations of PSR B1937+121.\n\n\n\nFigure 2 also shows another instrument, COBRA, which is being commissioned\nat the Jodrell Bank Observatory to replace the previous filterbank system.\nThis new system uses a de-dispersion method called \"coherent de-dispersion\"\nwhich is able to restore the original pulse shape completely. Although\nthis method requires substantial computing power, it removes all dispersion\nsmearing, producing much sharper pulses. Sharper pulses allow us to measure\nthe arrival times of pulses to a much higher precision which is important\nfor pulsar timing (see next section). The superiority of coherent de-dispersion\nover the \"incoherent\" filterbank method is shown for the pulse profile\nof PSR B1937+21 in Figure 3. \n\n\n\n4.2 Pulsar timing\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4(a). The residuals between a good model\nand actual pulse arrival times scatter around zero.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4(b). Increasing residuals due to wrong\nspin-down rate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4(c). Deviation with one year period\ndue to inaccurate position.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4(d). Deviation with one year period\nand increasing amplitude due to inaccurate proper motion.\n\n\n\n\nMany experiments involving pulsars are based on the ability to measure\nthe arrival times of their pulses. This technique is called \"pulsar timing\".\nFor instance, we have seen already that one can determine the age and the\nmagnetic field of pulsars by measuring the slow increase of pulse period\nwith time due to the slow down of their rotation. Many more applications\nwill be discussed after we reviewed all the effects which one has to take\ninto account. \nWe have already discussed the effects of dispersion on the arrival time\nof pulses. Much more fundamental is however, that the arrival time must\nbe different for any telescope and must also change with time of day and\ntime of year as any given telescope is moving in space due to the Earth's\nrotation and movement around the Sun. For our experiments we should refer\nto the arrival time at a point in the solar system which is at rest. Such\na point is the system's centre of mass, the so-called solar system barycentre. \nIf the pulsar is not too distant, we can measure a parallax effect in\nthe time of arrival providing a direct measurement of the pulsar distance.\n(To be precise, we measure the curvature of the incoming electromagnetic\nwaves!) \nGeneral relativity predicts additional delays when the pulse is propagating\nthrough gravitational potentials like that of the Sun. \nAll these effects have to be taken into account before we can attribute\nchanges in arrival time due to physical effects by the pulsar. We can summarise\nthem in the following equation which describes the transformation of the\nmeasured arrival to the time of emission in the pulsar frame.\n\n\nThe first term refers to a certain chosen epoch t0 as reference,\nthe second term describes the transformation to the solar system barycentre\n(r and s being vectors pointing from the telescope to the pulsar and Sun,\nrespectively), the third term accounts for dispersion with D being a constant\ndepending on the dispersion measure, while the fourth terns becomes relevant\nwhen the pulsar is close (d is the distance of the pulsars), so that parallax\neffects are important. The fifth term describes the aforementioned effects\npredicted by general relativity. \n\nThings become more complicated if the pulsar has a binary companion.\nIn that case, most of the effects present in the solar system will have\nto be accounted for in the binary system as well, which is indicated by\nthe last two terms. Binary pulsars are discussed in more detail in the\nnext section. \n\n\n\nAccounting for all possible effects including the pulsar spin down,\nwe should be able to predict the arrival times and to compare these predictions\nwith actual measurements. These differences between model predictions and\nobservations called \"residuals\" are plotted versus time and should vary\nrandomly around zero, as shown in Figure 4(a), if the model is correct. \n\nDeviations from a random appearance indicate unmodeled effects. \nAn inaccurate\nassumption about the pulsar spin down, for instance, leads to an increasing\ndeviation from the expected arrival time as in Figure 4(b). \n\n\nIf the assumed pulsar position is inaccurate, our transformation to\nthe solar system barycentre will be wrong too, creating a deviation from\nthe expected arrival time that depends on the position of the Earth in\nits orbit. Hence, the deviation will have a sinusoid shape with the period\nof one year, Figure 4(c). The amplitude then depends on the amount by which\nthe assumed position is wrong. \n\n\nIf the pulsar exhibits some proper motion that is not accounted for,\nits position must become increasingly inaccurate, producing an one-year\nsinusoid with increasing amplitude, Figure 4(d). \nIn an iterative procedure during which such deviations are identified,\nthe pulsar model is improved until the residuals show the expected random\ndistribution of Fig 4(a). Using this method, we can determine the pulse\nperiod and the pulsar spin down as well as astrometric parameters like\nposition and proper motion to an incredible accuracy. The accuracy achievable\nscales with the pulsar period, so that the best results are obtained for\nthe shortest periods i.e. the millisecond pulsars. The pulse period of\nPSR B1937+21 is, for instance, measured to be:\nP=0.0015578064924327 +/- 0.0000000000000004 seconds.\nSimilarly, positions and proper motions are measured to accuracies of\nmicroarcseconds and microarcseconds per year, respectively. This is better\nthan any other method currently available in astronomy. \n\n\n\n4.3 Timing binary pulsars\nThe presence of a companion to a pulsar affects the arrival time of\nthe pulses at Earth. This is (apart from additional relativistic corrections\nto be discussed later) due to the binary motion of the pulsar illustrated\nin Figure 5 and described by the 5 Keplerian parameters: orbital period;\nprojected semi-major axis of the orbit; eccentricity; and longitude and\nepoch of periastron. \nThese Keplerian parameters can be derived with pulsar timing in a similar\nway as is done for spectroscopic binaries in the optical regime. Figure\n6 shows, for instance, the variation of the 570-ms pulse period as measured\nfor the recently discovered PSR J1740-3052, which has the heaviest companion\nof any known pulsar in a 230-day orbit. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5. Binary parameters. Observer views\nfrom below.\n\n\nFigure 6. Variation of pulse period for pulsar\nPSR J1740-3052 due to binary motion. The dots are observed data and the\nline is the best-fit model.\n\n\n\n\nThe companion mass can be estimated from the mass function which is\nderived from Kepler's 3rd law and combines the observed Keplerian parameters\nwith the pulsar and companion mass. Using G as the gravitational constant,\nap  as the projected semi-major\naxis of the orbit, Pb as the orbital period and mp\nand mc as the mass of the pulsar and its companion, the mass\nfunction f is computed as: \n\n\n\nThe left hand side consists of observable parameters, which can be related\nto the masses on the right hand side.The inclination angle of the orbit,\ni, is in principle unknown, but by assuming an inclination of 90 deg, one\ncan at least derive a lower limit on the companion mass. In the\ncase of PSR J1740-3052, this is an amazing 11 solar masses. The nature\nof the companion is still unclear, and it has been speculated as to whether\nthis system could be the first pulsar-black hole binary system discovered. \nThe Keplerian parameters would describe the binary motion completely,\nif Newtonian physics were the correct theory of gravity. Albert Einstein\nhas demonstrated that this is not the case, when he introduced general\nrelativity. If general relativity, or any other theory of gravity deviating\nfrom Newtonian physics for that matter, is correct, we need additional\nparameters to describe the relativistic corrections needed to be made to\nthe Keplerian motion. These \"post-Keplerian\" parameters can also be determined\nby pulsar timing and can then be compared to predictions by general relativity\nor any other theory. The next section discusses how pulsars are the best\ntools to perform these relativistic tests. \n\n\n", "url": "http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/distance/frontiers/pulsars/section4.html", "hostname": "www.jb.man.ac.uk", "category": "uncategorized", "item_id": 19250525, "item_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19250525", "root_id": 19248790, "original_title": null}, {"title": "Einstein's Relativity and Everyday Life", "description": "Einstein's Relativity and Everyday Life", "url": "http://physicscentral.com/explore/writers/will.cfm", "hostname": "physicscentral.com", "category": "uncategorized", "item_id": 19249289, "item_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19249289", "root_id": 19248790, "original_title": null}, {"title": "Time dilation between Mars and Earth due to different mass", "description": "I am not sure I understand the Time dilation correctly but if mass has dirrect impact on time...than lets consider cosmological event - one orbit of planet Earth around Sun.

This makes it impossible to convert all stardates into equivalent calendar dates, especially since stardates were originally intended to avoid mentioning exactly when Star Trek takes place.[3]\n", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stardate", "hostname": "en.wikipedia.org", "category": "wiki_article", "item_id": 19249277, "item_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19249277", "root_id": 19248790, "original_title": null}, {"title": "The Darian System: Abstract", "description": "The Darian calendar is a complete timekeeping system for the 24-hour,\r\n39-minute, 35.244-second sol and the 668.5907-sol vernal equinox year on Mars.
