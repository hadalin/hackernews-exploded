Each entry\r\nis 32 bytes long. The number of sectors in the directory is fixed for the\r\nroot directory on FAT12 and FAT16 partitions, and sectors are consecutive\r\non disk. For non-root directories, as well as for the root directory on\r\nthe FAT32 partitions, the number of sectors is not fixed, and the directory\r\nis stored according to the normal cluster chain.\r\n\r\nThere are two different types of the entries for long filenames and\r\nfor aliases.\r\n\r\nAliases\r\nThe entry for an alias is:\r\n \r\n\n\nOffset in the Entry\nLength in Bytes\nDescription\n\n\n00\n8\nFilename\n\n\n08\n3\nExtension\n\n\n0B\n1\nAttribute\n\n\n0C\n1\nCase\n\n\n0D\n1\nCreation time in ms\n\n\n0E\n2\nCreation time\n\n\n10\n2\nCreation date\n\n\n12\n2\nLast access date\n\n\n14\n2\nHigh word of starting cluster for FAT32\n\n\n16\n2\nTime stamp\n\n\n18\n2\nDate stamp\n\n\n1A\n2\nStarting cluster\n\n\n1C\n4\nSize of the file\n\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFilename and extension are left-justified and blank-padded.\r\nNote that filename cannot consist solely of spaces, but extension can.\r\nWatch for illegal characters in filenames. My humble suggestion is replacing\r\nany illegal characters with underscores.\r\n\r\nSome characters in the filename have special meaning. If the first character\r\nhas the code 05, then actually the first character has the code\r\nE5 and it is not a special character. If the first character has\r\nthe code E5, then the file was deleted. You may save some time\r\nwhen going through the directory structure by checking the first character\r\nin the filename. If it is zero, there are no more entries in current directory.\r\n\r\nTwo entries have a special meaning. They are present only in subdirectories,\r\nbut not in the root directory. The entry with the name consisting of exactly\r\none dot is the pointer to the root directory. Its starting cluster is the\r\nfirst cluster of the root directory, which is usually two. You are best\r\nadvised to ignore this value because the location of the root directory\r\ncan be easily calculated otherwise. The entry with the name made up of\r\nexactly two dots points to the next higher-level directory in the hierarchy.\r\nIts starting cluster is the first cluster in that directory. These entries\r\nshould be the first and the second one in the directory, correspondingly.\r\nTheir attributes should be 10h (Directory). They are created at\r\nthe time the subdirectory is created. There are no corresponding long names\r\nfor them.\r\n\r\nAttribute is a collection of bit flags:\r\n \r\n\n\nValue\nMeaning\n\n\n01\nRead Only\n\n\n02\nHidden\n\n\n04\nSystem\n\n\n08\nVolume Label\n\n\n10\nDirectory\n\n\n20\nArchive\n\n\n40\nUnused\n\n\n80\nUnused\n\n\r\n \r\n\r\nRead Only, Hidden, and System are pretty self-explanatory. I will only\r\nnote that neither Hidden nor System files should be moved during defragmentation\r\nor any other disk service. If you remember, I recommended certain actions\r\nwhen file corruption is detected. You are best advised not to try any corrections\r\non Hidden or System files. Also, Hidden files should not be returned by\r\nsearch commands unless they were explicitly asked to do so.\r\n\r\nVolume label attribute means that this entry contains the disk label\r\nin the filename and extension fields. Volume label is valid only in the\r\nroot directory. Common sense says, there should be only one volume label\r\nper disk. For the entry to really contain the volume label, the attribute\r\nshould be exactly 08. If Attribute is equal to 0Fh\r\n(Read Only, Hidden, System, Volume Label) then this entry does not contain\r\nthe alias, but it is used as part of the long filename or long directory\r\nname.\nDirectory bit is set if the entry is a subdirectory. In this case the\r\nstarting cluster contains the beginning cluster for the subdirectory, and\r\nthe file size field is ignored (set to zero). Directories can also be Read\r\nOnly, Hidden, System, or Archive. Directory bit is not set for the long\r\ndirectory name entries.\r\n\r\nArchive bit is somewhat symbolic. It should be set if the file was not\r\narchived by the backup utility. Never in my life I have seen the use of\r\nthis bit.\r\n\r\nTwo values are unused, which means that the entries with either of these\r\nbits set should be considered invalid. Another invalid combination is when\r\nboth, Directory and Volume Label bits are set. Unless you are a disk analyzing\r\ntool, the best technique is to ignore the entries with the invalid attribute.\r\n\r\nCase is zero if the filename and extension need to\r\nbe converted to upper case. This field is used only by Windows NT.\r\n\r\nTime stamp and creation time have the following format:\r\n \r\n\n\nBits\nRange\nTranslated Range\nValid Range\nDescription\n\n\n0..4\n0..31\n0..62\n0..59\nSeconds/2\n\n\n5..10\n0..63\n0..63\n0..59\nMinutes\n\n\n11..15\n0..31\n0..31\n0..23\nHours\n\n\r\n \r\n\r\nDate stamp, last accessed date, and creation date have\r\nthe following format:\r\n \r\n\n\nBits\nRange\nTranslated Range\nValid Range\nDescription\n\n\n0..4\n0..31\n0..31\n1..28 up to 1..31\nDay, blame Julian for complexity\n\n\n5..8\n0..15\n0..15\n1..12\nMonth\n\n\n9..15\n0..127\n1980..2107\n1980..2107\nYear, add 1980 to convert\n\n\r\n \r\n\r\nGenerally, creation time and date say when the file was created. Accessed\r\ntime and date say when the file was last modified. Time and date stamps\r\nare set to the time that applications want you to think is the time of\r\nthe last modification.\r\n\r\nStarting cluster is the beginning cluster for the file\r\nor directory cluster chain. For FAT32, this value consists of the two 16-bit\r\nwords, and  the high four bits of the high word should be masked out.\r\nI have never seen any documentation regarding this, but a couple of hours\r\nof playing with FAT32 convinced me that this is the case.\r\n\r\nSize of the file specifies the real file size in bytes.\r\nThis value might be in conflict with the file size calculated by going\r\nthrough the cluster chain. Whenever they are in conflict, the smaller value\r\ntakes over.\r\n\r\nLong Filenames\r\nThe entries for long filenames look pretty odd because Microsoft tried\r\nto maintain compatibility with the older software. However, their format\r\nhas not changed in FAT32, which sounds somewhat ironic because FAT32 is\r\nin no way compatible with the older software. You may notice that these\r\nentries look much similar to those of aliases. The difference is, they\r\nuse the strange combination of attributes, so they are likely to be skipped\r\nby the older software. The word \"slot\" was used for these entries by Galen\r\nC. Hunt, and I will stay with his terminology.\r\n \r\n\n\nOffset in Entry\nLength in Bytes\nDescription\n\n\n00\n1\nSequence number for the slot\n\n\n01\n10d\nFirst five characters in filename\n\n\n0B\n1\nAttribute\n\n\n0C\n1\nReserved, always zero\n\n\n0D\n1\nAlias checksum\n\n\n0E\n12d\nNext six characters in filename\n\n\n1A\n2\nStarting cluster\n\n\n1C\n4\nLast two characters in filename\n\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe starting cluster number is always zero, and the attribute is always\r\n0Fh.\r\n\r\nSlots are always positioned right before the alias in the directory.\r\nThe closest to the alias slot contains the first thirteen characters of\r\nthe long filename. The slot above it contains the next thirteen characters,\r\nand so on, up to 256 characters. Additionally, the sequence number of the\r\nslot contains its number in the slot chain, starting from one. The sequence\r\nnumber for the last slot in the chain is or'ed with 40h to indicate\r\nend of chain.\r\n \r\n\n\nSlot Number\nSequence Number\nCharacters\n\n\n3\n43h\nme.text\n\n\n2\n02\ny long filena\n\n\n1\n01\nThis is a ver\n\n\nAlias\nAlias\nTHISIS~1.TEX\n\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIf the length of the filename is not the multiple of thirteen, the name\r\nin null-terminated. Otherwise, it is not null-terminated. If after null\r\ntermination there are any characters left in the slot, they are filled\r\nwith FFFF.\r\n\r\nChecksum contains the checksum for the corresponding alias. It is calculated\r\nin the following way:\r\nunsigned char sum, i;\nfor(sum=i=0; i<11; i++)\n    sum=(((sum&1)<<7)|((sum&0xFE)>>1))+name[i];\nIn a more common language, they rotate the sum right with cycling and\r\nadd the next character at each iteration. Note that the checksum is case-sensitive.\r\n\r\nWhen the file is deleted, all entries for the long filename start with\r\nE5.\r\n\r\nWhat can go wrong with long filenames? Give some space to your imagination...\r\n\r\nOperations\r\nLet us perform some operations with long filenames and aliases. I do not\r\ndescribe the steps that are related to cluster chain management because\r\nthey were already described. As for search operations, they should really\r\nbe performed in a different way to be any quick. However, the directory\r\nstructure itself does not suggest anything other than a sequential search.\r\n\r\nFind File by Alias\n\n\r\nStart from the top of the directory.\n\r\nCheck the first byte of the entry. If it is zero, finish.\n\r\nThen check the attribute. Skip the entry if the attribute is invalid, 0F,\r\nor does not correspond to the specific search demands.\n\r\nFinally, compare the filename and extension with the search pattern. Don't\r\nforget about wildcards.\n\r\nIf you have not found the needed entry yet, go to the next entry. Watch\r\nfor the end of the directory. If not end of the directory, go to step two.\n\n\r\nFind File by Long Name\n\n\r\nStart from the top of the directory.\n\r\nCheck the first byte of the entry. Exit the loop if it is zero. Skip to\r\nthe next entry if it is not one and not 41h.\n\r\nRetrieve the long name. Skip to the next entry in case of an error at this\r\nstage. Compare the long name against your search string. If you search\r\noperation has any restrictions for attributes, date, etc. use the fields\r\nof the corresponding alias for comparison. Skip to the next entry if the\r\ncurrent one doesn't match.\n\r\nIf you have not found the needed entry, go to the next one. Watch for end\r\nof directory.\n\n\r\nRetrieve the Long Name\n\n\r\nStart from the entry with the sequence number one or 41h. Start\r\nwith an empty string. The string must be at least 512 bytes long. Any error\r\nin the first entry should be interpreted as an invalid long name. Any error\r\nin the next entries should end up in the valid but truncated long name.\r\nInvalid long name is signaled by the empty string on return.\n\r\nCheck the attribute. It must be 0Fh.\n\r\nIf sequence number is one or 41h, check the next entry in the\r\ndirectory. It must be the alias for the long name. Check if its attribute\r\nis valid. Calculate the checksum.\n\r\nCompare the checksum in the slot with the checksum calculated for the alias.\r\nThey must be equal.\n\r\nConcatenate the current string and the strings in the slot. Remember that\r\nstrings may be null-terminated. Watch for the invalid characters and replace\r\nthem with underscores.\n\r\nIf sequence number and 40h, or the string in the slot is null-terminated,\r\nor out of buffer space, return your current string.\n\r\nElse go to the previous entry in the directory. Watch for the beginning\r\nof the directory.\n\n\r\nAllocate New Entry\r\nWhen you need to allocate a new entry in the directory, look through the\r\nentries from the beginning. Use the first one that is marked as deleted\r\nor the first one that has zero as the first character of the filename.\r\nExpand the directory if no entries are free. Also follow this simple algorithm\r\nto allocate the block of consecutive entries. You will need it for aliasing.\r\nYou can make it a bit smarter by overwriting the deleted entries only after\r\nall free entries are used up, but because the probability that deleted\r\nfiles will be recovered is low and memory for the directory cache is expensive,\r\nI do not recommend it.\r\n\r\nDelete and Undelete File or Directory\r\nTo delete the file:\r\n\n\r\nSet the first character of the alias to E5.\n\r\nSet the first byte for each of the slots for the long name to E5.\n\r\nFill the cluster chain with zeroes.\n\r\nTo delete the directory, follow these very steps, but first check if the\r\ndirectory to be deleted is empty. Empty directory consists of no entries\r\nbut \".\", \"..\", and, possibly, deleted entries. Do not\r\ndelete the directory unless it is empty.\r\n\r\nBecause the directory entry is otherwise untouched, recovery is possible.\r\nHowever, recovery is not guaranteed. Furthermore, it is not guaranteed\r\nthat the recovered file will have the same contents as the original file.\r\nTo recover the deleted file:\r\n\n\r\nFind the directory entry marked as deleted. Begin from the starting cluster\r\nand check the number of the consecutive FAT entries corresponding to the\r\nfile size. If they all are zero, build a file chain through them and conclude\r\nthat undeleting is completed. If any is marked as physically bad, just\r\nskip it. Otherwise, conclude that undeleting is impossible.\n\r\nAsk the user for the first character in the filename, or get the first\r\ncharacter from the long filename. Write the first character to the directory\r\nentry (for the alias).\n\r\nRead the previous directory entry, if any. If this entry is also marked\r\nas deleted and its attribute is 0F, this is probably the first\r\nslot for the long filename. Continue going up the directory while these\r\nconditions are true. Build the chain for the long filename.\n\n\r\nCreate New Directory\n\n\r\nAllocate the necessary number of entries. You should have enough space\r\nto store the alias and, possibly, the long filename. The case when the\r\nlong filename is not created was mentioned earlier.\n\r\nAllocate at least one cluster. The recommended number of clusters is such\r\na number that can contain 512 directory entries.\n\r\nWrite the first two required entries \".\" and \"..\".\n\r\nWrite the alias and the long filename. Set the beginning cluster field\r\nof the alias to the just allocated cluster chain.\n\n\nAuthor:  Alex Verstak \r\n3/10/1998\r\n \r\n", "url": "http://averstak.tripod.com/fatdox/dir.htm", "hostname": "averstak.tripod.com", "category": "uncategorized", "item_id": 19243246, "item_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19243246", "root_id": null, "original_title": "The structure of the special type of DOS files called directories (1998)"}, {"title": "Famous laws of Software development", "description": "Like any other field, the world of Software Development has some interesting and famous rules, principles and laws.

I hope that this list may serve as a \r\nuseful “road map” to other undergraduates picking their way through Eckhart \r\nLibrary. In the end, of course, you must explore on your own; but the list may \r\nsave you a few days wasted reading books at the wrong level or with the wrong \r\nemphasis. \r\nThe list is biased in two senses. One, it is light on foundations and applied \r\nareas, and heavy (especially in the advanced section) on geometry and topology; \r\nthis is a consequence of my interests. I welcome additions from people \r\ninterested in other fields. Two, and more seriously, I am an honors-track \r\nstudent and the list reflects that. I don't list any “regular” analysis or \r\nalgebra texts, for instance, because I really dislike the ones I've seen. If you \r\nare a 203 student looking for an alternative to the awful pink book \r\n(Marsden/Hoffman), you will find a few here; they are all much clearer, better \r\nbooks, but none are nearly as gentle. I know that banging one's head against a \r\nmore difficult text is not a realistic option for most students in this \r\nposition. On the other hand, reading mathematics can't be taught, and it has to \r\nbe learned sometime. Maybe it's better to get used to frustration as a way of \r\nlife sooner, rather than later. I don't know. \r\nReviews not marked with initials, or marked with [CJ], were written by \r\nme, Chris Jeris ('98).

Thanks to all of them for \r\ntheir input. \r\nJump to the elementary, intermediate, \r\nor advanced \r\nsections. \r\nWarning: Statements about books I haven't looked at in a couple of years may \r\nbe factually incorrect; please forgive my spotty memory. I don't think I have \r\nany really egregious falsehoods in here. I apologize for the appearance of this \r\npage; most web browsers have not yet been updated to handle the HTML4 entity \r\nset, so fools like me who read the definition write ugly-looking pages. \r\nEnough apologia. Here we go: \r\n\n\n\nELEMENTARYThis includes “high school topics” and first-year \r\ncalculus. \r\nContents\n\nAlgebra (4) \r\n  Geometry (2) \r\n\r\n  Foundations \r\n  (1) \r\n  Problem \r\n  solving (4) \r\n  Calculus (6) \r\n\r\n  Bridges to \r\n  intermediate topics (2) \n\n\nAlgebra\nGelfand/Shen, Algebra\nGelfand/Glagoleva/Shnol, Functions and graphs\nGelfand/Glagoleva/Kirillov, The method of coordinates\nThese three little white books come from the Soviet correspondence school in \r\nmathematics, run by I. M. Gelfand for interested people of all ages in the \r\nfurther reaches of the USSR. Rather than trying to be artificially \r\n“down-to-earth” in the way Americans do, Gelfand simply assumes that you can \r\nunderstand the mathematics as it's done (and avoids the formal complexities \r\nmathematicians are inured to). YSP and SESAME give these out by the carload to \r\ntheir students, who mostly love them. TMoC is notable for its intriguing \r\nfour-axis scheme for making flat graphs of R^4. Overall a fresh, \r\ninspiring look at topics we take for granted, and a good thing to recommend to \r\nbright younger students or friends (or parents!) \r\nCohen, Precalculus with unit circle trigonometry\n[RV] I used this book in high school and absolutely loved it. It's \r\nvery skimpy on proofs, and really should not be used for that sort of insight. \r\nHowever, in terms of understanding how to apply various mathematical concepts \r\nit's wonderful. It has a large number of graphs, examples, and easy reference \r\ntables. It covers all the algebra, trig, and cartesian geometry that any good \r\nhigh school math sequence should deal with. I have used it for years as a \r\nreference book (e.g., what exactly is Cramer's rule again...) Solutions to a \r\nnumber of the problems are in the back, and the problems are not entirely \r\napplications. \nGeometry\nEuclid, The elements\nNo, I'm not kidding. At first it's incredibly annoying and tedious to read, \r\nbut after a while you get into the flow of the language and the style. Euclid \r\nteaches you both the power of the modern algebraic methods and the things that \r\nare hidden by our instinct to assign a number to a length. Besides, there \r\nare wonderful tidbits here and there (did you know that Euclid invented the \r\nDedekind cut?). At least check it out once, to read his proof of the Pythagorean \r\ntheorem. (Thanks to Jonathan Beere ('95) for convincing me it was worthwhile.) \r\n[PC] I have Volume I, and I have to admit I haven't really read it. I \r\ndo think that I would benefit if someone rammed some of it down my throat \r\nthough, because nowadays we undergraduates are trained to regard “geometric” as \r\na strong pejorative—the very antithesis of rigor and proof. \r\nCoxeter, Geometry revisited\nThis is a text on “advanced Euclidean geometry”, starting with the numberless \r\nclassical “centers” of a triangle and proceeding from there. Many good \r\nexercises. There are lots of “college geometry” texts you can find this stuff \r\nin, but most of them are aimed at math-ed majors; this book and Coxeter's other \r\none (see below) have them all beat. \r\n[PC] I like this book. I don't own it but I've flipped through it more \r\nthan once and I agree that it has a pleasantly non-brain-dead quality to it. \r\nThere are interesting geometric facts that you probably haven't seen before in \r\nhere. \nFoundations\nRucker, Infinity and the mind\n[RV] This is not really a math book. It is a friendly introduction to \r\nthe concept of infinity, transfinite numbers, and related paradoxes. I'd \r\nrecommend it to high school students who are intrested in math, but not quite \r\nready to sit down and read though proof after proof of theorems. (In fact, I \r\nfirst read it in high school as part of an independent study math class.) The \r\nbook does contain some proofs, but not in the rigorous form of a standard math \r\ntext. It does include more historical background on the concepts than most math \r\ntexts do, which is nice. Each chapter is accompanied by problems, and an answer \r\nkey (with explanations) is at the end of the book. \nProblem solving (pre-college)\nNML problem books\nThe MAA publishes a series called “New Mathematical Library” which contains \r\nmany excellent titles aimed at or below college sophomore level (Geometry \r\nrevisited is among them). In this series are four books of problems given on \r\nthe AHSME, one of USAMO and two of IMO problems, all with solutions. We use the \r\nAHSME books extensively at YSP; the USAMO and IMO problems still give me a rough \r\ntime, and are fun if you're looking for frustration one evening. \r\nLarson, Problem solving through problems\nAfter you grapple with the IMO problems for a while, turn here to find a book \r\nthat teaches (as much as any book can) the art of solving them. Cognitive \r\nstrategies are laid out with examples of problems (mostly from Olympiads and \r\nPutnams) to which they apply. \r\n[PC] I own this, or at least I did—I haven't seen it since high \r\nschool. I'm really not a big contest problem-solver, but I did use this \r\nbook and I think it helped to prepare me for Chicago Mathematics. Lots of good \r\nproblems, not all of them inane. \r\nPólya, How to solve it\nI haven't read this, but it's supposed to be the “classic” version of Larson \r\nabove. \r\nPólya, Mathematics and plausible reasoning, I and II\n[PC] These are the “sequels” to Pólya's How to solve it. They \r\nare definitely interesting, although their main interest may be \r\npsychological/philosophical (only relative to mathematics do philosophy and \r\npsychology merge!) I'm not sure that one can really become a significantly \r\nbetter problem-solver by reading a book about the nature of mathematical \r\nreasoning, but I admire Pólya for writing an interesting and challenging book \r\nabout the practice of mathematics; such books are in my opinion too few \r\nand far between. \r\nIn 1997–98 a few books with the same general theme as Larson, but different \r\nproblem collections, have been published; I haven't seen any of them. \nCalculus\nOf course, as we all know, the One True Calculus Book is \r\nSpivak, Calculus\nThis is a book everyone should read. If you don't know calculus and have the \r\ntime, read it and do all the exercises. Parts 1 and 2 are where I finally \r\nlearned what a limit was, after three years of bad-calculus-book “explanations”. \r\nThe whole thing is the most coherently envisioned and explained treatment of \r\none-variable calculus I've seen (you can see throughout that Spivak has a \r\nvision of what he's trying to teach). \r\nThe book has flaws, of course. The exercises get a little monotonous because \r\nSpivak has a few tricks he likes to use repeatedly, and perhaps too few of them \r\ndeal with applications (but you can find that kind of exercise in any book). \r\nAlso, he sometimes avoids sophistication at the expense of clarity, as in the \r\nproofs of Three Hard Theorems in chapter 8 (where a lot of epsilon-pushing takes \r\nthe place of the words “compact” and “connected”). Nevertheless, this is the \r\nbest calculus book overall, and I've seen it do a wonderful job of brain \r\nrectification on many people. \r\n[PC] Yes, it's good, although perhaps more of the affection comes from \r\nmore advanced students who flip back through it? Most of my exposure to this \r\nbook comes from tutoring and grading for 161, but I seriously believe that \r\nworking as many problems as possible (it must be acknowledged that many of them \r\nare difficult for first year students, and a few of them are really \r\nhard!) is invaluable for developing the mathematical maturity and epsilonic \r\ntechnique that no math major should be without. \r\nOther calculus books worthy of note, and why: \r\nSpivak, The hitchhiker's guide to calculusJust what the title \r\nsays. I haven't read it, but a lot of 130s students love it. \r\nHardy, A course of pure mathematics\nCourant, Differential and integral calculus\nThese two are for “culture”. They are classic treatments of the calculus, \r\nfrom back when a math book was rigorous, period. Hardy focuses more on \r\nconceptual elegance and development (beginning by building up R). Courant \r\ngoes further into applications than is usual (including as much about Fourier \r\nanalysis as you can do without Lebesgue integration). They're old, and old books \r\nare hard to read, but usually worth it. (Remember what Abel said about reading \r\nthe masters and not the pupils!) \r\nApostol, Calculus\nThis is “the other” modern rigorous calculus text. Reads like an upper-level \r\ntext: lemma-theorem-proof-corollary. Dry but comprehensive (the second volume \r\nincludes multivariable calculus). \r\nJanusz, Calculus\nThe worst calculus book ever written. This was the 150s text in 1994–95; it \r\ntries to give a Spivak-style rigorous presentation in colorful \r\nmainstream-calculus-book format and reading level. Horrible. Take a look at it \r\nto see how badly written a mathematics book can be. \nBridges to intermediate topics\nSpringer-Verlag has just begun a new series of texts designed to bring \r\nstudents gently into the realm of abstract mathematics. While there is no \r\nshortage of such books, these seem better than average pedagogically; they are \r\nall quite talky, include complete solutions to all exercises, and cover sensible \r\n(as opposed to traditional) sets of topics. The series is called SUMS, for \r\nSpringer Undergraduate Mathematics Series. Two so far seem noteworthy: Smith, \r\nIntroduction to mathematics: algebra and analysis and Johnson, \r\nIntroduction to logic via numbers and sets. Give them a look. \r\n\n\n\nINTERMEDIATERoughly, general rather than specialized texts in \r\nhigher mathematics. I would not hesitate to recommend any book here to honors \r\nsecond-years, but they might not find easy going in some of them. \r\nContents\n\nFoundations \r\n  (5) \r\n  General \r\n  abstract algebra (7) \r\n  Linear \r\n  algebra (3) \r\n  Number \r\n  theory (5) \r\n  Combinatorics \r\n  and discrete mathematics (1) \r\n  Real \r\n  analysis (10) \r\n  Multivariable \r\n  calculus (2) \r\n  Complex \r\n  analysis (5) \r\n  Differential \r\n  equations (2) \r\n  Point-set \r\n  topology (5) \r\n  Differential \r\n  geometry (4) \r\n  Classical \r\n  geometry (3) \n\n\nFoundations\nHalmos, Naive set theory\nThe best book for a first encounter with “real” set theory. Like everything \r\nPaul Halmos writes, it's stylistically beautiful. A very skinny book, broken \r\ninto very short sections, each dealing with a narrow topic and with an exercise \r\nor three. It requires just a little sophistication, but no great experience with \r\n“real” math; we use this one for YSP kids sometimes too. \r\nFraenkel, Abstract set theory\nFraenkel was the F in ZFC, and he gives a suitably rigorous development of \r\nset theory from an axiomatic viewpoint. Unfortunately, for the philosophical \r\nfoundations of the axioms he refers to another book (Fraenkel and Bar-Hillel, \r\nFoundations of set theory), which is missing from Eckhart Library. Good \r\nfor culture. \r\nEbbinghaus/Flum/Thomas, Mathematical logic\nThe only logic book I can name off the top of my head, this is the 277 book. \r\nI found it readable but boringly syntactic (well, maybe that's elementary \r\nlogic). \r\nEnderton, A mathematical introduction to logic\nLook, another logic book! This one might be preferable just because there's \r\nmuch more talking about what's going on and less unmotivated symbol-pushing than \r\nin E/F/T. The flip side of that is, the constructions may or may not be epsilon \r\nless precise. I'm not a logician; if you are, write some reviews so I can \r\nreplace these lousy ones! \r\nLandau, Foundations of analysis\nThis is the book that invented the infamous Landau “Satz-Beweis” \r\n(theorem-proof) style. There is nothing in this book except the \r\ninexorable progression of theorems and proofs, which is perhaps appropriate for \r\na construction of the real numbers from nothing, but makes horrible bathroom \r\nreading. Read for culture. \nGeneral abstract algebra\nThe situation here is problematic, because there are many good books which \r\nare just a little hard to swallo", "url": "https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~abhishek/chicmath.htm", "hostname": "www.ocf.berkeley.edu", "category": "uncategorized", "item_id": 19245813, "item_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19245813", "root_id": 19244570, "original_title": null}, {"title": "Library - Product Gems", "description": "Here is a collection of my favourite behavioural science related books.

We and some\nothers think there are currently two aspects of WireGuard that make\nits deployment in a privacy-focused setting a bit challenging. The\ngoal of this email is to present current thoughts on the issues and\nfacilitate discussion. It contains language and ideas from others who\nhave commented on this elsewhere. Thank you. Feel free to make\nyourselves known. Any errors are mine however.\n\nThe two issues are:\n* WireGuard does not offer identity hiding forward secrecy\n* WireGuard does not offer dynamic IP address assignment\n\nTogether with other interested parties I hope to arrive at a good\nsolution to these issues, which can be adopted by any apps that want\nto offer privacy. The time to do this is now, before WireGuard reaches\nmassive adoption and multiple incompatible hacks are made.\n\nYou might care about this if you:\n* Run a VPN proxy/server where you or your users care about privacy\n* Use a commercial VPN service\n* Provide a commercial VPN service\n\n\n-WireGuard does not offer identity hiding forward secrecy-\n\n--The problem--\nIn the context of a VPN service the peers can be viewed as Client(s)\nand Server. A key compromise of the VPN server's static private key\nmakes an attacker able to decrypt recorded handshakes and thus\ncorrelate all connections made using any given client static key, i.e.\nVPN user. Here's how:\n\n1. An attacker records encrypted traffic flows to/from a VPN server.\n\n2. Time passes. The attacker gets hold of the VPN server's static\nprivate key, by raiding a data centre, breaking into a VPN server\nhost, or something else.\n\n3. The attacker uses the VPN server static private key to decrypt the\nrecorded handshakes, revealing client static pubkeys.\n\n4. The attacker uses client static pubkeys to correlate traffic flows\nwith particular users including possibly linking individuals to client\npubkeys through other data sources, e.g. VPN provider business records\nor other IP address metadata.\n\n--Nuances--\nA successful attack requires both the capability to record traffic\nflows as well as to compromise the server key. Still, the lack of\nidentity hiding forward secrecy means WireGuard offers worse privacy\nthan e.g. OpenVPN in this respect.\n\nIt should be noted that both WireGuard and OpenVPN send tunnel session\nIDs in the clear. A user that roams between networks will probably\nleak the session ID between them. On the other hand, a user that\nexplicitly disconnects on network 1 and reconnects the VPN tunnel on\nnetwork 2 will have a new tunnel session ID that is not linkable to\nthe first one. In this case OpenVPN (assuming user/pass auth and not\nclient-cert) will have identity hiding forward secrecy, and WireGuard\ndoes not.\n\nIf a WireGuard user application connects with a new pubkey every time\na new tunnel is established, it will provide the same identity hiding\nproperties as OpenVPN. However depending on the position of the\nsurveillance equipment and the method of key compromise neither\nOpenVPN nor WireGuard would be sufficient protection. That's\nout-of-scope for this discussion however.\n\n--Proposed mitigation--\nIn order to get identity hiding forward secrecy the suggestion is to\nhave the client change its static pubkey often in order to de-link VPN\nsessions, in the event of a compromise of the server's static private\nkey. “Often” might be a time limit, a bandwidth limit, and events like\nreboot of the system, the app, new WiFi, new DHCP lease, or explicitly\nby the user. To provide the same properties as OpenVPN it should be\nenough to change pubkey every time the user does a connect/disconnect.\n\nThis should probably be a functionality on top of WireGuard, which\nshould stay minimal. It should be possible for clients to register new\nstatic pubkeys with the VPN service and to ask it to forget about old\npubkeys. One current idea is to define a service on top of WireGuard\nrunning as a daemon on both client and server, communicating over a\nWireGuard session.\n\n\n-WireGuard does not offer dynamic IP address assignment-\n\n--The problem--\nThe tunnel-internal IP address can leak through WebRTC and perhaps\nother ways. A long term IP address assignment could enable a website\nthat exfiltrates the IP address to use it as a unique identifier\nbetween website visits, even if the user has cleared all browsing\ndata. There are other ways of doing this.\n\nA perhaps more serious consequence of static assignment is that the IP\naddress is stored linked to a user's static public key, which in turn\nmight be linked to a user’s personal identity through the server’s\nauthentication system. If the attacker learns the IP address as well\nas gains access to the user database, it might be able to link the IP\naddress to a person.\n\nIn a commercial VPN service setup, the IP address and thus its static\npublic key are probably linked to a customer account, and to payment\ninformation. If this is the case, an attacker might be able to\nidentify the user. There are various mitigations and hacks one could\ndo as an operator to prevent this. Regardless, an approach to\nephemeral IP addresses that is accepted as standard would be\npreferable.\n\n--Proposed mitigation--\nMake it possible for clients to request a dynamically assigned IP\naddress from the VPN server. One idea is to define a service on top of\nWireGuard running as a daemon on both client and server, communicating\nover a WireGuard session. The client would need a statically assigned\nlink-local IPv6 address and use that to communicate with the\nserver-side daemon, which then assigns an IP address dynamically.\n\n\n-What's been done already?-\n\nAn effort has already started regarding the dynamic IP addresses. Read\nthe following for more info:\nhttps://www.wireguard.com/todo/\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/11RJDDrdIsnGivz8xP5NsOteHdviuV4jfNG1CSl0q8cY/edit\nhttps://git.zx2c4.com/wg-dynamic\n\nOne issue with an in-tunnel daemon is authentication of client and\nserver. It’s possible the client side of the WireGuard tunnel is\nactually a router for many more clients, who probably shouldn’t be\nauthorized to renegotiate the router’s dynamic IP address or pubkey.\nAn alternative to an in-tunnel daemon would be to use peer-addressed\ndatagrams for control messages instead, but that introduces other\ncomplexities as mentioned in the documents above.\n\n\n-Summary-\nA privacy-focused deployment of WireGuard should provide identity\nhiding forward secrecy and short-term dynamic IP address assignment.\nWireGuard provides neither, since it's out-of-scope for the project's\ngoals, for good reasons. One solution would be to define a service\nthat communicates over a WireGuard tunnel. The same service could\nprovide API calls for both needs, as well as other things.\n\nFinally, it would be good if the mechanism and protocol remained the\nsame regardless of if one was connecting to a lone WireGuard server,\nor to a WireGuard server in a network of many, such as a large VPN\nservice provider. I for one expect WireGuard to become the standard\nVPN protocol for VPN services within a few years, and that they will\ncontinue to grow until then. To my knowledge the largest ones today\nrun almost 10,000 servers.\n\n\nThank you for your time.\n\nBest regards,\nFredrik Stromberg\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious message: Support ip6tables-like network masks for allowed-ips besides CIDR\n\nNext message: WireGuard deployment considerations for improved privacy\n\n Messages sorted by:\n[ date ]\n[ thread ]\n[ subject ]\n[ author ]\n\n\n\nMore information about the WireGuard\nmailing list\n", "url": "https://lists.zx2c4.com/pipermail/wireguard/2019-January/003777.html", "hostname": "lists.zx2c4.com", "category": "uncategorized", "item_id": 19244283, "item_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19244283", "root_id": 19242058, "original_title": null}, {"title": "WireGuard VPN: What You Need to Know - NOT (Yet) Recommended", "description": "WireGuard is an interesting new VPN protocol that has the potential to bring major change to the VPN industry.

A small\ncommercial VPN provider approached me recently about the fact they could see\nthe allowed IPs mapping easily with WireGuard, whereas with OpenVPN it was\nhidden deep inside a process they didn't know how to debug. \"Great,\" I\nthought. Not so fast. They were concerned that when compelled to retrieve this\nkind of information, they would no longer be able to claim, \"we don't know\nhow,\" since WireGuard makes it so easy. So, they hired me for a day to develop\nand open source a small solution for their unique use case and odd scenario.\n\nBefore reading further, do you have the same bizarre requirement? Probably\nnot. In that likely case, please keep reading only under the scope of,\n\"something somebody else thought they needed, but I don't need myself.\" In\nother words, don't use this code.\n\nNot wanting to hack up WireGuard or add configuration nobs -- or really\ncompromise any of what the project is about in response to these kinds of\nrequests -- I thought I'd write a small \"defensive rootkit,\" which most\ncertainly kills both your kitten and your neighbor's parrot.\n\nIt started out by just hooking the Netlink API to zero out the endpoints and\nallowedips for each peer. Then I disabled tcpdump. Then I disabled /dev/mem,\n/dev/kmem, /dev/port, /proc/kcore, and module loading. Things were looking\nfairly clean, until I needed to add compatibility support for old kernels, and\nthen I reverted to some cthulhu-style x86 opcode parsing and writing to proc\nfrom kernelspace and other atrocities. It seems to work relatively well on\nthe kernels I've tested, but of course there are no guarantees with this kind\nof stuff. In any case, there aren't very many public rootkit examples like\nthis, so at the very least it might be an aid to a college freshman doing an\nassignment for his \"Intro to Computer Security\" course.\n\nKeep in mind that there are several ways to subvert each and every defense\nthat this thing introduces. Several ways! All of the defenses! Subverted! For\nthat reason, you shouldn't use this if you're relying on the impossibility of\nsubversion.

In October 2017, subsequent reports alleged that hackers working for the Russian government stole confidential data from the home computer of an National Security Agency contractor via Kaspersky antivirus software. Kaspersky denied the allegations, reporting that the software had detected Equation Group malware samples which it uploaded to its servers for analysis in its normal course of operation. The company has since announced commitments to increased accountability, such as soliciting independent reviews and verification of its software's source code, and announcing that it would migrate some of its core infrastructure for foreign customers from Russia to Switzerland.\n", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaspersky_bans_and_allegations_of_Russian_government_ties", "hostname": "en.wikipedia.org", "category": "wiki_article", "item_id": 19244330, "item_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19244330", "root_id": 19242058, "original_title": null}, {"title": "Post-FCC Privacy Rules, Should You VPN? —  Krebs on Security", "description": "Many readers are understandably concerned about recent moves by the U.S. Congress that would roll back privacy rules barring broadband Internet service providers (ISPs) from sharing or selling customer browsing history, among other personal data.
