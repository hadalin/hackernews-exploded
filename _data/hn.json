While it's not finished, we're up to nearly 800 patches, and\nso maintaining it out-of-tree is becoming a bit unruly...and it's in\nsolid enough shape that it could benefit from being in-tree.\n\nI've opened a merge request here:\nhttps://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/merge_requests/283\n\nFor now, Iris will build and install alongside i965 - with i965\nremaining the default driver.  Iris is still considered experimental.\n\nMore details below...\n\n--Ken\n\nWhat is Iris?\n-------------\n\nThe new \"Iris\" driver prototype is essentially our Mesa i965 driver\nreimagined and rebuilt from the ground up.  Our main goal was to make\nthe driver as efficient as possible, aiming for very low CPU overhead.\nWe also decided to drop support for legacy hardware and outdated kernel\ndrivers, freeing us up to design for the future without worrying about\nimpacting the past.  This let us ask, \"if we were doing it all\nagain...what would we want it to look like?\"\n\nWhile designing the new driver, we drew a lot of inspiration from our\nnewer Vulkan driver, as well as a few other Gallium drivers.\n\nKey Changes\n-----------\n\n* All new state upload code is dramatically more efficient.\n\n  In CPU overhead microbenchmarks, Iris can issue on average\n  3 times as many draw calls per second as our i965 driver.\n\n* Supports only Broadwell and newer (Gen8+); drops support for\n  the older Gen4-7.5 GPUs, as well as Braswell/Cherrytrail.\n\n* Updated memory management takes full advantage of modern PPGTT\n  support, allocating VMA in userspace for greater control, and\n  allowing us to pre-bake state containing addresses.\n\n* Requires a modern Linux kernel (v4.16+, could be v4.5 if needed).\n\n* Leverages Mesa's \"Gallium\" driver framework, allowing us to share\n  more code and development effort with the rest of the community.\n\nWhile many pieces are new, much of the driver remains the same.\nWe continue using these components of our existing stack:\n\n* The Mesa OpenGL API front-end\n* The Mesa shader compiler (GLSL, SPIR-V, NIR, i965 Gen-assembly backend)\n* The Intel Surface Layout (ISL) library\n* The Intel Blit-on-Render-Pipe (BLORP) library\n* The i965 auxiliary surface resolve tracker\n* The i965 buffer manager (extended, but largely reused)\n\nQ&A\n---\n\nQ: How do I build and use Iris?\n\nIris only supports the Meson and Android build systems (sorry, no\nAutotools or SCons support).  To build Iris, use -Dgallium-drivers=iris\nwhen running Meson.  -Ddri-drivers=i965 will also build i965.\n\ni965 remains the default driver (assuming it's built).  You can try\nout Iris on a per-application basis by setting an environment variable:\n\n   $ export MESA_LOADER_DRIVER_OVERRIDE=iris\n\nPlease note that Iris requires a modern kernel, such as 4.19+.\n\nQ: Should I use Iris yet?\n\nIris is not considered stable or ready for production use - it's still\nvery experimental.  However, it is largely feature complete (a few less\ncommonly-used features are missing), and is passing roughly 99% of the\nPiglit test suite and OpenGL CTS.  We have not done extensive testing\nor benchmarking of games and applications yet.\n\nIf you're feeling adventurous, feel free to try it out and report\nissues at https://bugs.freedesktop.org/ under product Mesa and the\nDrivers/Gallium/Iris component.  Or ask us on IRC (irc.freenode.net\nchannel #intel-3d).\n\nQ: Are there any known issues?\n\n* Currently, Glamor rendering, and shaders using gl_VertexID, may not\n  work correctly.  This will be fixed shortly after merging.\n\n* GPU reset support is poor - if it hangs, it will likely hang\n  repeatedly until the kernel bans it.  Chris Wilson and I are\n  working on a solution for this.\n\n* There is a known kernel memory leak in some 4.18 kernels, which\n  Iris can provoke.  The fix has already been backported, but a few\n  distros didn't pick it up before moving on to 4.19+.  Please use\n  the latest available kernel.\n\n* Performance is expected to be slower than i965 for the moment, in\n  many cases, but this will improve in the days to come.  There are\n  still a number of stall avoidance paths which have not been hooked\n  up yet, which can lead to the GPU idling.  Fast clears support is\n  missing, and end-to-end color compression is not working yet.\n\n  We expect it to be faster in the long run, and it already is in\n  some particular cases.  For one customer, Iris is 18% faster than\n  i965.  Your mileage may vary until the driver matures a bit more.\n\nQ: What's with the commit history?\n\nThe commit history in this merge request is largely the actual\nnon-idealized history for bringing up the driver, rather than the\ntidy patch series we're used to seeing.  I decided that preserving\nthe history mostly as-is might be of interest to other people who\nare considering bringing up a new driver, to see how I did it.\nAlso, after a year of work, I wanted to be able to fairly attribute\npeople's work, and squashing it would not have done that justice.\n\nDuring development, I rebased the driver on master periodically.\nAt the end, I went back and ensured that the driver would at least\ncompile at each step, so that people can bisect across it without\nas many issues.  I also squashed some obvious fixup commits.  But\nit's largely still the original history.\n\nQ: Who developed Iris?\n\nAccording to git shortlog, the following people contributed patches\nto Iris which made it into the original MR:\n\n    Kenneth Graunke (732)\n    Jordan Justen (14)\n    Dave Airlie (13)\n    Chris Wilson (12)\n    Rafael Antognolli (8)\n    Jason Ekstrand (7)\n    Caio Marcelo de Oliveira Filho (3)\n    Andre Heider (2)\n    Rhys Kidd (1)\n    Sagar Ghuge (1)\n    Tapani PÃ¤lli (1)\n    Timur KristÃ³f (1)\n\nThis understates the work, however, as we've reused a lot of code\nfrom our existing drivers and infrastructure, so my thanks to the\nwhole Intel Mesa team, and the entire Mesa community.  Particular\nthanks to Dave Airlie, Ilia Mirkin, Marek OlÅ¡Ã¡k, and Eric Anholt,\nand others for answering a lot of questions about Gallium.\n\nIn any list of acknowledgments, I am sure to have missed people;\nsorry for the omission, and thank you nonetheless!\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: signature.asc\nType: application/pgp-signature\nSize: 833 bytes\nDesc: This is a digitally signed message part.\nURL: <https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/mesa-dev/attachments/20190220/51f78fed/attachment-0001.sig>\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious message (by thread): [Mesa-dev] [Bug 109532] ir_variable has maximum access out of bounds -- but it's not out of bounds\n\nNext message (by thread): [Mesa-dev] [Bug 109698] dri.pc contents invalid when built with meson\n\n Messages sorted by:\n[ date ]\n[ thread ]\n[ subject ]\n[ author ]\n\n\n\nMore information about the mesa-dev\nmailing list\n", "url": "https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/mesa-dev/2019-February/215576.html", "hostname": "lists.freedesktop.org", "category": "uncategorized", "comment_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19233045"}, {"title": "Don’t lead by example – James Cowling – Medium", "description": "Dispelling a common leadership myth.", "url": "https://medium.com/@jamesacowling/dont-lead-by-example-4f86b1174e64", "hostname": "medium.com", "category": "uncategorized", "comment_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19218313"}, {"title": "Task Relevant Maturity: A Management Concept Great Leaders use Daily", "description": "Leaders must learn many management concepts to effectively lead.

In the fall of 2002,\none was created to teach operating systems engineering.  In the course lectures,\nthe class worked through Sixth Edition Unix (aka V6) using\nJohn Lions's famous commentary.  In the lab assignments, students wrote most of\nan exokernel operating system, eventually named Jos, for the Intel x86.\nExposing students to multiple systems–V6 and Jos–helped develop a\nsense of the spectrum of operating system designs.\n\n\nV6 presented pedagogic challenges from the start.\nStudents doubted the relevance of an obsolete 30-year-old operating system\nwritten in an obsolete programming language (pre-K&R C)\nrunning on obsolete hardware (the PDP-11).\nStudents also struggled to learn the low-level details of two different\narchitectures (the PDP-11 and the Intel x86) at the same time.\nBy the summer of 2006, we had decided to replace V6\nwith a new operating system, xv6, modeled on V6\nbut written in ANSI C and running on multiprocessor\nIntel x86 machines.\nXv6's use of the x86 makes it more relevant to\nstudents' experience than V6 was\nand unifies the course around a single architecture.\nAdding multiprocessor support requires handling concurrency head on with\nlocks and threads (instead of using special-case solutions for\nuniprocessors such as\nenabling/disabling interrupts) and helps relevance.\nFinally, writing a new system allowed us to write cleaner versions\nof the rougher parts of V6, like the scheduler and file system.\n6.828 substituted xv6 for V6 in the fall of 2006. \n\nXv6 sources and text\n\nThe latest xv6 source and text are available via\ngit clone git://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-public.git\nand\ngit clone git://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-book.git\nWe also distribute the sources as a printed booklet with line numbers\nthat keep everyone together during lectures.  The booklet is available as xv6-rev11.pdf,\nalong with a commentary/textbook. The line numbers in this commentary/book refer to the source booklet.\n\nxv6 compiles using the GNU C compiler,\ntargeted at the x86 using ELF binaries.\nOn BSD and Linux systems, you can use the native compilers;\nOn OS X, which doesn't use ELF binaries,\nyou must use a cross-compiler.\nXv6 does boot on real hardware, but typically\nwe run it using the QEMU emulator.\nBoth the GCC cross compiler and QEMU\ncan be found on the 6.828 tools page.\n\nXv6 lecture material\n\nIn 6.828, the lectures in the first half of the course cover the xv6 sources and\ntext.  The lectures in the second half consider advanced topics using research\npapers; for some, xv6 serves as a useful base for making discussions concrete.\nThe lecture notes are available from the 6.828 schedule page.\n\nXv6 homeworks\n\nThe Xv6 homeworks consist of small programming exercises that extend xv6 in\ninteresting ways. By getting their hands dirty with xv6, students have an\nopportunity to absorb xv6 and explore ideas that are not covered\nin the text.  The homeworks are available from the 6.828 schedule page.\n\n\nUnix Version 6\n6.828's xv6 is inspired by Unix V6 and by:\n\n\nLions' Commentary on UNIX' 6th Edition, John Lions, Peer to\nPeer Communications; ISBN: 1-57398-013-7; 1st edition (June 14, 2000).\n\t\nAn on-line version of the Lions\n\tcommentary, and the source code.\n\n\n\tThe v6 source code is also available \n\t  online\n\t  through The Unix Heritage Society.\n\n\t\n\n\nThe following are useful to read the original code:\n\n\nThe PDP11/40 Processor Handbook, Digital Equipment Corporation, 1972.\n\nA PDF (made from scanned images, \nand not text-searchable)\nA web-based\nversion that is indexed by instruction name.\n\n\nFeedback\nIf you are interested in using xv6 or have used xv6 in a course,\nwe would love to hear from you.\nIf there's anything that we can do to make xv6 easier\nto adopt, we'd like to hear about it.\nWe'd also be interested to hear what worked well and what didn't.\n\nRuss Cox (rsc@swtch.com)\nFrans Kaashoek (kaashoek@mit.edu)\nRobert Morris (rtm@mit.edu)\n\nYou can reach all of us at 6.828-staff@pdos.csail.mit.edu.\n\n\n\n\nQuestions or comments regarding 6.828?
