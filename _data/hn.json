In this groundbreaking book, Nancy Leveson proposes a new approach to safety—more suited to today's complex, sociotechnical, software-intensive world—based on modern systems thinking and systems theory. Revisiting and updating ideas pioneered by 1950s aerospace engineers in their System Safety concept, and testing her new model extensively on real-world examples, Leveson has created a new approach to safety that is more effective, less expensive, and easier to use than current techniques.Arguing that traditional models of causality are inadequate, Leveson presents a new, extended model of causation (Systems-Theoretic Accident Model and Processes, or STAMP), then shows how the new model can be used to create techniques for system safety engineering, including accident analysis, hazard analysis, system design, safety in operations, and management of safety-critical systems. She applies the new techniques to real-world events including the friendly-fire loss of a U.S. Blackhawk helicopter in the first Gulf War; the Vioxx recall; the U.S. Navy SUBSAFE program; and the bacterial contamination of a public water supply in a Canadian town.

However, on September 23, 1999, communication with the spacecraft was lost as the spacecraft went into orbital insertion, due to ground-based computer software which produced output in non-SI units of pound-force seconds (lbf·s) instead of the SI units of newton-seconds (N·s) specified in the contract between NASA and Lockheed.

Want to tag a location or take a photo, but don't want that app to be able to use the camera or get your location whenever it wants? Bouncer gives you exactly that. As soon as you exit the app, Bouncer will automatically remove the permission for you in an instant so you can get back to doing what you do best, without having to worry about apps invading your privacy and wasting your battery.\n\nNote: Bouncer is designed for one-time permissions, not for permissions where you only want the app to have them in the foreground. Bouncer can be used for both purposes but as you use apps throughout the day they will be in the foreground a lot of the time.\n\n• Increased security, privacy and battery life\n• Never have to worry what apps are doing in the background\n• No complicated setup needed (no root or adb)\n\nHow does it work?\nBouncer uses an accessibility service. It activates when you grant a permission and gives you the option to remove it. When you go home, Bouncer will open the app's settings and remove the permission for you extremely quickly.\n\nWhy should I trust Bouncer?\nYes, an app that can turn off permissions can also turn them on. But Bouncer requests no permissions. It cannot see info inside apps except for the settings app (so it can turn permissions off). Bouncer doesn't have the internet permission so even if it could get sensitive info (which it can't) it couldn't transmit it anywhere. All these facts are easily verifiable for anyone to check.\n\nIf you're having problems with Bouncer please read the troubleshooting guide in settings and use the contact support option if it cannot be fixed.", "url": "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.samruston.permission", "hostname": "play.google.com", "category": "uncategorized", "comment_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19238946"}, {"title": "GlassWire Data Usage Monitor - Apps on Google Play", "description": "GlassWire makes it easy to monitor your mobile data usage, data limits, and WiFi Internet activity in real-time.

Developing it wouldn’t require much effort—just a few days of an engineer’s time—but it was one of hundreds of ideas proposed, and the program managers deemed it a low priority. So it languished for more than six months, until an engineer, who saw that the cost of writing the code for it would be small, launched a simple online controlled experiment—an A/B test—to assess its impact. Within hours the new headline variation was producing abnormally high revenue, triggering a “too good to be true” alert. Usually, such alerts signal a bug, but not in this case. An analysis showed that the change had increased revenue by an astonishing 12%—which on an annual basis would come to more than $100 million in the United States alone—without hurting key user-experience metrics.

That may be true, but\nthere are still some guiding principles behind the evolution of the kernel;\none of those, to date, has been that the kernel does not recognize\n\"containers\" as objects in their own right.  Instead, the kernel provides\nthe necessary low-level features, such as namespaces and control groups, to\nallow user space to create its own container abstraction.  This refusal to\ndictate the nature of containers has led to a diverse variety of container\nmodels and a lot of experimentation.  But that doesn't stop those who would\nstill like to see the kernel recognize containers as first-class\nkernel-supported objects.\n", "url": "https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/780364/51230bfb2f59ce05/", "hostname": "lwn.net", "category": "uncategorized", "comment_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19237724"}], "categories": ["site", "repository", "wiki_article", "amazon_item", "video", "tweet", "subreddit", "reddit_post", "news", "uncategorized"]}
