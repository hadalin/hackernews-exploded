It is thus independent of coordinates, and a Lorentz scalar.[1] The proper time interval between two events on a world line is the change in proper time. This interval is the quantity of interest, since proper time itself is fixed only up to an arbitrary additive constant, namely the setting of the clock at some event along the world line. The proper time interval between two events depends not only on the events but also the world line connecting them, and hence on the motion of the clock between the events. It is expressed as an integral over the world line. An accelerated clock will measure a smaller elapsed time between two events than that measured by a non-accelerated (inertial) clock between the same two events.

The American mathematician Richard Hamming pioneered this field in the 1940s and invented the first error-correcting code in 1950: the Hamming (7,4) code.[2]\nThe redundancy allows the receiver to detect a limited number of errors that may occur anywhere in the message, and often to correct these errors without retransmission. ECC gives the receiver the ability to correct errors without needing a reverse channel to request retransmission of data, but at the cost of a fixed, higher forward channel bandwidth. ECC is therefore applied in situations where retransmissions are costly or impossible, such as one-way communication links and when transmitting  to multiple receivers in multicast. For example, in the case of a satellite orbiting around Uranus, a retransmission because of decoding errors can create a delay of 5 hours. ECC information is usually added to mass storage devices to enable recovery of corrupted data, is widely used in modems, and is used on systems where the primary memory is ECC memory.\n", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_correction_code", "hostname": "en.wikipedia.org", "category": "wiki_article", "item_id": 19248788, "item_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19248788", "root_id": 19247633, "original_title": null}, {"title": "Clock recovery - Wikipedia", "description": "In serial communication of digital data, clock recovery is the process of extracting timing information from a serial data stream to allow the receiving circuit to decode the transmitted symbols.

Gates is remarkable for \"the way his mind integrates things into a big-picture view in real time,\" said Craig Mundie, Microsoft's chief research and strategy officer, one of two executives assuming Gates' duties.  Microsoft's aggressive culture showed in the business tactics that led to the landmark antitrust suits against the company in the U.S. and Europe.  With Gates at the helm, Microsoft became the world's largest software company and a central figure in the technology world.  \"Basically, Bill took on IBM and won, and that created an environment of excitement, where the whole company was focused on managing the explosion of the PC business,\" said Bob Herbold, the retired Microsoft chief operating officer.  [...] his shift away from Microsoft could influence internal and external perceptions of the company, said Amy Wohl, an industry analyst who has followed the company for much of its history.  In a May 1997 e-mail exchange, also turned over during one of the company's trials, then-Microsoft executive Ben Slivka wrote privately to Maritz that Gates had been \"amazingly, unnecessarily rude\" -- accusing Slivka of \"trying to destroy Windows,\" among other things.  In his response at the time, Maritz followed the Microsoft tradition of calling Gates by his e-mail alias: \"One of Billg's faults (and it is a real fault) is that he does not [give] positive feedback when it is needed,\" he wrote.", "url": "https://www.seattlepi.com/business/article/No-Bull-Bill-Gates-blunt-legacy-1277370.php", "hostname": "www.seattlepi.com", "category": "uncategorized", "item_id": 19248923, "item_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19248923", "root_id": 19247869, "original_title": null}, {"title": "Bush's Legacy on Africa Wins Praise", "description": null, "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2013/04/george-w-bushs-legacy-on-africa-wins-praise-even-from-foes/", "hostname": "abcnews.go.com", "category": "news", "item_id": 19248776, "item_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19248776", "root_id": 19247869, "original_title": null}, {"title": "Polio", "description": "Polio is an infectious disease for which there is no cure.

clear how to generalize them to k-ary trees,\nand I recently noticed an unexpected ordering that I’d like to know more about.\nIf you know of references to this ordering, please leave a comment\nor email me (rsc@swtch.com).\nBinary Tree Orderings\n\nFirst a refresher about binary-tree orderings\nto set up an analogy to k-ary trees.\n\n\nPreorder visits a node before its left and right subtrees:\n\n\n\n\nInorder visits a node between its left and right subtrees:\n\n\n\n\nPostorder visits a node after its left and right subtrees:\n\n\n\n\nEach picture shows the same 16-leaf, 31-node binary tree, with the nodes\nnumbered and also placed horizontally using the order\nvisited in the given traversal.\n\n\nIt was observed long ago that one way to represent a tree\nin linear storage is to record the nodes in a fixed order\n(such as one of these), along with a separate array giving\nthe number of children of each node.\nIn the pictures, the trees are complete, balanced trees, so the\nnumber of children of each node can be derived from\nthe number of total leaves.\n(For more, see Knuth Volume 1 §2.3.1;\nfor references, see §2.3.1.6, and §2.6.)\n\n\nIt is convenient to refer to nodes in a tree by\na two-dimensional coordinate (l, n), consisting of the level of\nthe node (with 0 being the leaves) and its sequence number at that level.\nFor example, the root of the 16-node tree has coordinate (4, 0),\nwhile the leaves are (0, 0) through (0, 15).\n\n\nWhen storing a tree using a linearized ordering such as these,\nit is often necessary to be able to convert a two-dimensional\ncoordinate to its index in the linear ordering.\nFor example,\nthe right child of the root—node (3, 1)—has\nnumber 16, 23, and 29\nin the three different orderings.\n\n\nThe linearized pre-ordering of (l, n) is given by:\n\nseq(L, 0) = 0 (L is height of tree)\nseq(l, n) = seq(l+1, n/2) + 1 (n even)\nseq(l, n) = seq(l+1, n/2) + 2l+1 (n odd)\n\nThis ordering is awkward because it changes depending on the height of the tree.\n\n\nThe linearized post-ordering of (l, n) is given by:\n\nseq(0, n) = n + n/2 + n/4 + n/8 + ...\nseq(l, n) = seq(l–1, 2 n + 1) + 1 = seq(0, 2l n + 2l – 1) + l\n\nThis ordering is independent of the height of the tree,\nbut the leaf numbering is still a little complex.\n\n\nThe linearized in-ordering is much more regular.\nIt’s clear just looking at it that seq(0, n) = 2 n,\nand in fact a single equation applies to all levels:\n\nseq(l, n) = 2l+1 n + 2l – 1\n\nIf you need to linearize a complete binary tree,\nusing the in-order traversal has the simplest math.\nk-ary Tree Orderings\n\nThe three binary orderings\ncorrespond to visiting the node after 0, 1, or 2 of\nits child subtrees.\nTo generalize to k-ary trees,\nwe can visit the node after any number\nof subtrees from 0 to k,\nproducing k+1 orderings.\nFor example, for k = 3,\nhere are the four generalized orderings\nof a 27-leaf, 39-node 3-ary tree:\n\n\nPreorder (inorder-0):\n\n\n\n\nInorder-1:\n\n\n\n\nInorder-2:\n\n\n\n\nPostorder (inorder-3):\n\n\n\n\nJust looking at the leaves of each, none of them\nhas a nice simple form with regular gaps\nlike the seq(0, n) = 2 n of in-order traversal\nfor binary trees.\nInstead, both the possible “in-order” traversals\nend up with equations more like the post-order traversal.\nWhat happened?\nWhere did the nice, regular pattern go?\nAn Unexpected Ordering\n\nIn a binary tree, the in-order numbering has the property that\nafter the first leaf, one new parent (non-leaf) node is introduced\nbefore each additional one leaf.\nThis works out nicely because the number of parent nodes in a binary\ntree of N leaves is N–1.\nThe number of parents nodes in a k-ary tree of N leaves is\n(N–1)/(k–1),\nso we could try to build a nicer numbering\nby,\nafter the first leaf,\nintroducing one new parent node\nbefore each additional k–1 leaf nodes.\nThat is, the leaves would be numbered by\n\nseq(0, n) = n + (n+k–2)/(k–1),\n\nwhich gives this leaf structure:\n\n\n\n\nBut how do we fill in the gaps?\nThe first three triples—0, 2, 3 and 5, 6, 8 and 9, 11, 12—clearly\nget nodes 1, 4, 7, and 10 as their three parents and one grandparent,\nbut which is the grandparent?\nThe binary in-order traversal was very self-similar,\nso let’s try the same thing here:\nafter the first node,\nreserve one node for higher levels\nbefore each k–1 nodes at this level.\nThat is, the parents are 1, 7, 10,\nand the grandparent is 4.\n\n\nApplying this process throughout the tree,\nwe end up with this traversal order (inorder-G, for gap-induced):\n\n\n\n\nFor contrast, here is the ordering from the previous section\nthat visited each node after its first subtree (inorder-1):\n\n\n\n\nThe inorder-1 traversal has a regular tree structure but irregular numbering.\nIn contrast, the inorder-G traversal has an irregular tree structure but very\nregular numbering that generalizes the binary inorder numbering:\n\nseq(l, n) = kl (n+k–2)/(k–1) + kl-1 + kl-2 + ... + k0\n\nFor a binary tree, inorder-1 and inorder-G are the same:\nthe traversal has both a regular tree structure and a regular numbering.\nBut for k-ary trees, it seems you can pick only one.\n\n\nThe regularity of the numbering is easiest to see in base k.\nFor example, here is the binary inorder traversal with binary numbering:\n\n\n\n\nThe bottom row uses numbers ending in 0;\nthe next row up uses numbers ending in 01;\nthen 011; and so on.\n\n\nFor the 3-ary tree, it is the inorder-G traversal (not inorder-1 or inorder-2) that produces an equivalent pattern:\n\n\n\n\nThe bottom row uses numbers ending in 0 or 2;\nthe next row up uses numbers ending in 01 or 21;\nthen 011 or 211; and so on.\nThe general rule is that\n\nseq(l, n) = ((n+k–2)/(k–1))k || (1)kl\n\nwhere (x)k means x written as a base-k number,\n|| denotes concatenation of base-k numbers,\nand\n(1)kl\nmeans the base-k digit 1 repeated l times.\n\n\nThrough a roundabout way, then, we’ve ended up with a\ntree traversal that’s really just a nice base-k encoding.\nThere must be existing uses of this encoding,\nbut I’ve been unable to find any or even determine what its name is.\nFurther Reading?\n\nDoes anyone know of any places this has appeared before? I’d love to read about them.

Like a B-tree, a fractal tree index is a generalization of a binary search tree in that a node can have more than two children.  Furthermore, unlike a B-tree, a fractal tree index has buffers at each node, which allow insertions, deletions and other changes to be stored in intermediate locations.  The goal of the buffers is to schedule disk writes so that each write performs a large amount of useful work, thereby avoiding the worst-case performance of B-trees, in which each disk write may change a small amount of data on disk.   Like a B-tree, fractal tree indexes are optimized for systems that read and write large blocks of data.  The fractal tree index has been commercialized in databases by Tokutek.  Originally, it was implemented as a cache-oblivious lookahead array,[1] but the current implementation is an extension of the Bε tree.[2]  The Bε is related to the Buffered Repository Tree.[3]  The Buffered Repository Tree has degree 2, whereas the  Bε tree has degree  Bε.  The fractal tree index has also been used in a prototype filesystem.[4][5] An open source implementation of the fractal tree index is available,[6] which demonstrates the implementation details outlined below.\n", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal_tree_index", "hostname": "en.wikipedia.org", "category": "wiki_article", "item_id": 19248139, "item_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19248139", "root_id": 19247538, "original_title": null}, {"title": "Data is in the eye of the beholder – Topics in Sustainable Fisheries", "description": "Sustainable Fisheries", "url": "https://sites.uw.edu/bevanseries/2018/02/28/data-is-in-the-eye-of-the-beholder/", "hostname": "sites.uw.edu", "category": "uncategorized", "item_id": 19244051, "item_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19244051", "root_id": null, "original_title": "Data is in the eye of the beholder"}, {"title": "Oldest Viable Laptop", "description": "Whatâs the oldest laptop you could reasonably do your job with? 3 years old? 5 years? 10?

Each entry\r\nis 32 bytes long. The number of sectors in the directory is fixed for the\r\nroot directory on FAT12 and FAT16 partitions, and sectors are consecutive\r\non disk. For non-root directories, as well as for the root directory on\r\nthe FAT32 partitions, the number of sectors is not fixed, and the directory\r\nis stored according to the normal cluster chain.\r\n\r\nThere are two different types of the entries for long filenames and\r\nfor aliases.\r\n\r\nAliases\r\nThe entry for an alias is:\r\n \r\n\n\nOffset in the Entry\nLength in Bytes\nDescription\n\n\n00\n8\nFilename\n\n\n08\n3\nExtension\n\n\n0B\n1\nAttribute\n\n\n0C\n1\nCase\n\n\n0D\n1\nCreation time in ms\n\n\n0E\n2\nCreation time\n\n\n10\n2\nCreation date\n\n\n12\n2\nLast access date\n\n\n14\n2\nHigh word of starting cluster for FAT32\n\n\n16\n2\nTime stamp\n\n\n18\n2\nDate stamp\n\n\n1A\n2\nStarting cluster\n\n\n1C\n4\nSize of the file\n\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFilename and extension are left-justified and blank-padded.\r\nNote that filename cannot consist solely of spaces, but extension can.\r\nWatch for illegal characters in filenames. My humble suggestion is replacing\r\nany illegal characters with underscores.\r\n\r\nSome characters in the filename have special meaning. If the first character\r\nhas the code 05, then actually the first character has the code\r\nE5 and it is not a special character. If the first character has\r\nthe code E5, then the file was deleted. You may save some time\r\nwhen going through the directory structure by checking the first character\r\nin the filename. If it is zero, there are no more entries in current directory.\r\n\r\nTwo entries have a special meaning. They are present only in subdirectories,\r\nbut not in the root directory. The entry with the name consisting of exactly\r\none dot is the pointer to the root directory. Its starting cluster is the\r\nfirst cluster of the root directory, which is usually two. You are best\r\nadvised to ignore this value because the location of the root directory\r\ncan be easily calculated otherwise. The entry with the name made up of\r\nexactly two dots points to the next higher-level directory in the hierarchy.\r\nIts starting cluster is the first cluster in that directory. These entries\r\nshould be the first and the second one in the directory, correspondingly.\r\nTheir attributes should be 10h (Directory). They are created at\r\nthe time the subdirectory is created. There are no corresponding long names\r\nfor them.\r\n\r\nAttribute is a collection of bit flags:\r\n \r\n\n\nValue\nMeaning\n\n\n01\nRead Only\n\n\n02\nHidden\n\n\n04\nSystem\n\n\n08\nVolume Label\n\n\n10\nDirectory\n\n\n20\nArchive\n\n\n40\nUnused\n\n\n80\nUnused\n\n\r\n \r\n\r\nRead Only, Hidden, and System are pretty self-explanatory. I will only\r\nnote that neither Hidden nor System files should be moved during defragmentation\r\nor any other disk service. If you remember, I recommended certain actions\r\nwhen file corruption is detected. You are best advised not to try any corrections\r\non Hidden or System files. Also, Hidden files should not be returned by\r\nsearch commands unless they were explicitly asked to do so.\r\n\r\nVolume label attribute means that this entry contains the disk label\r\nin the filename and extension fields. Volume label is valid only in the\r\nroot directory. Common sense says, there should be only one volume label\r\nper disk. For the entry to really contain the volume label, the attribute\r\nshould be exactly 08. If Attribute is equal to 0Fh\r\n(Read Only, Hidden, System, Volume Label) then this entry does not contain\r\nthe alias, but it is used as part of the long filename or long directory\r\nname.\nDirectory bit is set if the entry is a subdirectory. In this case the\r\nstarting cluster contains the beginning cluster for the subdirectory, and\r\nthe file size field is ignored (set to zero). Directories can also be Read\r\nOnly, Hidden, System, or Archive. Directory bit is not set for the long\r\ndirectory name entries.\r\n\r\nArchive bit is somewhat symbolic. It should be set if the file was not\r\narchived by the backup utility. Never in my life I have seen the use of\r\nthis bit.\r\n\r\nTwo values are unused, which means that the entries with either of these\r\nbits set should be considered invalid. Another invalid combination is when\r\nboth, Directory and Volume Label bits are set. Unless you are a disk analyzing\r\ntool, the best technique is to ignore the entries with the invalid attribute.\r\n\r\nCase is zero if the filename and extension need to\r\nbe converted to upper case. This field is used only by Windows NT.\r\n\r\nTime stamp and creation time have the following format:\r\n \r\n\n\nBits\nRange\nTranslated Range\nValid Range\nDescription\n\n\n0..4\n0..31\n0..62\n0..59\nSeconds/2\n\n\n5..10\n0..63\n0..63\n0..59\nMinutes\n\n\n11..15\n0..31\n0..31\n0..23\nHours\n\n\r\n \r\n\r\nDate stamp, last accessed date, and creation date have\r\nthe following format:\r\n \r\n\n\nBits\nRange\nTranslated Range\nValid Range\nDescription\n\n\n0..4\n0..31\n0..31\n1..28 up to 1..31\nDay, blame Julian for complexity\n\n\n5..8\n0..15\n0..15\n1..12\nMonth\n\n\n9..15\n0..127\n1980..2107\n1980..2107\nYear, add 1980 to convert\n\n\r\n \r\n\r\nGenerally, creation time and date say when the file was created. Accessed\r\ntime and date say when the file was last modified. Time and date stamps\r\nare set to the time that applications want you to think is the time of\r\nthe last modification.\r\n\r\nStarting cluster is the beginning cluster for the file\r\nor directory cluster chain. For FAT32, this value consists of the two 16-bit\r\nwords, and  the high four bits of the high word should be masked out.\r\nI have never seen any documentation regarding this, but a couple of hours\r\nof playing with FAT32 convinced me that this is the case.\r\n\r\nSize of the file specifies the real file size in bytes.\r\nThis value might be in conflict with the file size calculated by going\r\nthrough the cluster chain. Whenever they are in conflict, the smaller value\r\ntakes over.\r\n\r\nLong Filenames\r\nThe entries for long filenames look pretty odd because Microsoft tried\r\nto maintain compatibility with the older software. However, their format\r\nhas not changed in FAT32, which sounds somewhat ironic because FAT32 is\r\nin no way compatible with the older software. You may notice that these\r\nentries look much similar to those of aliases. The difference is, they\r\nuse the strange combination of attributes, so they are likely to be skipped\r\nby the older software. The word \"slot\" was used for these entries by Galen\r\nC. Hunt, and I will stay with his terminology.\r\n \r\n\n\nOffset in Entry\nLength in Bytes\nDescription\n\n\n00\n1\nSequence number for the slot\n\n\n01\n10d\nFirst five characters in filename\n\n\n0B\n1\nAttribute\n\n\n0C\n1\nReserved, always zero\n\n\n0D\n1\nAlias checksum\n\n\n0E\n12d\nNext six characters in filename\n\n\n1A\n2\nStarting cluster\n\n\n1C\n4\nLast two characters in filename\n\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe starting cluster number is always zero, and the attribute is always\r\n0Fh.\r\n\r\nSlots are always positioned right before the alias in the directory.\r\nThe closest to the alias slot contains the first thirteen characters of\r\nthe long filename. The slot above it contains the next thirteen characters,\r\nand so on, up to 256 characters. Additionally, the sequence number of the\r\nslot contains its number in the slot chain, starting from one. The sequence\r\nnumber for the last slot in the chain is or'ed with 40h to indicate\r\nend of chain.\r\n \r\n\n\nSlot Number\nSequence Number\nCharacters\n\n\n3\n43h\nme.text\n\n\n2\n02\ny long filena\n\n\n1\n01\nThis is a ver\n\n\nAlias\nAlias\nTHISIS~1.TEX\n\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIf the length of the filename is not the multiple of thirteen, the name\r\nin null-terminated. Otherwise, it is not null-terminated. If after null\r\ntermination there are any characters left in the slot, they are filled\r\nwith FFFF.\r\n\r\nChecksum contains the checksum for the corresponding alias. It is calculated\r\nin the following way:\r\nunsigned char sum, i;\nfor(sum=i=0; i<11; i++)\n    sum=(((sum&1)<<7)|((sum&0xFE)>>1))+name[i];\nIn a more common language, they rotate the sum right with cycling and\r\nadd the next character at each iteration. Note that the checksum is case-sensitive.\r\n\r\nWhen the file is deleted, all entries for the long filename start with\r\nE5.\r\n\r\nWhat can go wrong with long filenames? Give some space to your imagination...\r\n\r\nOperations\r\nLet us perform some operations with long filenames and aliases. I do not\r\ndescribe the steps that are related to cluster chain management because\r\nthey were already described. As for search operations, they should really\r\nbe performed in a different way to be any quick. However, the directory\r\nstructure itself does not suggest anything other than a sequential search.\r\n\r\nFind File by Alias\n\n\r\nStart from the top of the directory.\n\r\nCheck the first byte of the entry. If it is zero, finish.\n\r\nThen check the attribute. Skip the entry if the attribute is invalid, 0F,\r\nor does not correspond to the specific search demands.\n\r\nFinally, compare the filename and extension with the search pattern. Don't\r\nforget about wildcards.\n\r\nIf you have not found the needed entry yet, go to the next entry. Watch\r\nfor the end of the directory. If not end of the directory, go to step two.\n\n\r\nFind File by Long Name\n\n\r\nStart from the top of the directory.\n\r\nCheck the first byte of the entry. Exit the loop if it is zero. Skip to\r\nthe next entry if it is not one and not 41h.\n\r\nRetrieve the long name. Skip to the next entry in case of an error at this\r\nstage. Compare the long name against your search string. If you search\r\noperation has any restrictions for attributes, date, etc. use the fields\r\nof the corresponding alias for comparison. Skip to the next entry if the\r\ncurrent one doesn't match.\n\r\nIf you have not found the needed entry, go to the next one. Watch for end\r\nof directory.\n\n\r\nRetrieve the Long Name\n\n\r\nStart from the entry with the sequence number one or 41h. Start\r\nwith an empty string. The string must be at least 512 bytes long. Any error\r\nin the first entry should be interpreted as an invalid long name. Any error\r\nin the next entries should end up in the valid but truncated long name.\r\nInvalid long name is signaled by the empty string on return.\n\r\nCheck the attribute. It must be 0Fh.\n\r\nIf sequence number is one or 41h, check the next entry in the\r\ndirectory. It must be the alias for the long name. Check if its attribute\r\nis valid. Calculate the checksum.\n\r\nCompare the checksum in the slot with the checksum calculated for the alias.\r\nThey must be equal.\n\r\nConcatenate the current string and the strings in the slot. Remember that\r\nstrings may be null-terminated. Watch for the invalid characters and replace\r\nthem with underscores.\n\r\nIf sequence number and 40h, or the string in the slot is null-terminated,\r\nor out of buffer space, return your current string.\n\r\nElse go to the previous entry in the directory. Watch for the beginning\r\nof the directory.\n\n\r\nAllocate New Entry\r\nWhen you need to allocate a new entry in the directory, look through the\r\nentries from the beginning. Use the first one that is marked as deleted\r\nor the first one that has zero as the first character of the filename.\r\nExpand the directory if no entries are free. Also follow this simple algorithm\r\nto allocate the block of consecutive entries. You will need it for aliasing.\r\nYou can make it a bit smarter by overwriting the deleted entries only after\r\nall free entries are used up, but because the probability that deleted\r\nfiles will be recovered is low and memory for the directory cache is expensive,\r\nI do not recommend it.\r\n\r\nDelete and Undelete File or Directory\r\nTo delete the file:\r\n\n\r\nSet the first character of the alias to E5.\n\r\nSet the first byte for each of the slots for the long name to E5.\n\r\nFill the cluster chain with zeroes.\n\r\nTo delete the directory, follow these very steps, but first check if the\r\ndirectory to be deleted is empty. Empty directory consists of no entries\r\nbut \".\", \"..\", and, possibly, deleted entries. Do not\r\ndelete the directory unless it is empty.\r\n\r\nBecause the directory entry is otherwise untouched, recovery is possible.\r\nHowever, recovery is not guaranteed. Furthermore, it is not guaranteed\r\nthat the recovered file will have the same contents as the original file.\r\nTo recover the deleted file:\r\n\n\r\nFind the directory entry marked as deleted. Begin from the starting cluster\r\nand check the number of the consecutive FAT entries corresponding to the\r\nfile size. If they all are zero, build a file chain through them and conclude\r\nthat undeleting is completed. If any is marked as physically bad, just\r\nskip it. Otherwise, conclude that undeleting is impossible.\n\r\nAsk the user for the first character in the filename, or get the first\r\ncharacter from the long filename. Write the first character to the directory\r\nentry (for the alias).\n\r\nRead the previous directory entry, if any. If this entry is also marked\r\nas deleted and its attribute is 0F, this is probably the first\r\nslot for the long filename. Continue going up the directory while these\r\nconditions are true. Build the chain for the long filename.\n\n\r\nCreate New Directory\n\n\r\nAllocate the necessary number of entries. You should have enough space\r\nto store the alias and, possibly, the long filename. The case when the\r\nlong filename is not created was mentioned earlier.\n\r\nAllocate at least one cluster. The recommended number of clusters is such\r\na number that can contain 512 directory entries.\n\r\nWrite the first two required entries \".\" and \"..\".\n\r\nWrite the alias and the long filename. Set the beginning cluster field\r\nof the alias to the just allocated cluster chain.\n\n\nAuthor:  Alex Verstak \r\n3/10/1998\r\n \r\n", "url": "http://averstak.tripod.com/fatdox/dir.htm", "hostname": "averstak.tripod.com", "category": "uncategorized", "item_id": 19243246, "item_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19243246", "root_id": null, "original_title": "The structure of the special type of DOS files called directories (1998)"}, {"title": "File versioning - Tenet language", "description": "These are presently ideas for how to implement support for versioning in a file format.", "url": "https://tenet-lang.org/versioning.html", "hostname": "tenet-lang.org", "category": "uncategorized", "item_id": 19247518, "item_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19247518", "root_id": 19243246, "original_title": null}, {"title": "I wrote FAT on an airplane, for heaven’s sake", "description": "When you wrote code for 16-bit Windows, one of the things you spent time doing as part of performance tuning was deciding which functions should be grouped together in which segments.

But if you're counting percentage of\npeople (or households), there's just no more doubling after you pass 50%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeter Norvig\n", "url": "http://www.norvig.com/norvigs-law.html", "hostname": "www.norvig.com", "category": "uncategorized", "item_id": 19246724, "item_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19246724", "root_id": 19245485, "original_title": null}, {"title": "The Lessons of ValuJet 592", "description": "As a reconstruction of this terrible crash suggests, in complex systems some accidents may be \"normal\"—and trying to prevent them all could even make operations more dangerous", "url": "https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1998/03/the-lessons-of-valujet-592/306534/", "hostname": "www.theatlantic.com", "category": "uncategorized", "item_id": 19246917, "item_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19246917", "root_id": 19245485, "original_title": null}, {"title": "Murphy's law - Wikipedia", "description": "Murphy's law is an adage or epigram that is typically stated as: \"Anything that can go wrong will go wrong\".\n", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy%27s_law#Association_with_Murphy", "hostname": "en.wikipedia.org", "category": "wiki_article", "item_id": 19246940, "item_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19246940", "root_id": 19245485, "original_title": null}, {"title": "Ghost - The Professional Publishing Platform", "description": "Open source technology for fiercely independent publishers.
