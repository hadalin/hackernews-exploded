These mappings are then translated into detailed visualization specifications in the form of Vega specification ...", "url": "https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/examples/", "hostname": "vega.github.io", "category": "uncategorized", "item_id": 19746578, "item_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19746578", "root_id": 19737227, "original_title": null}, {"title": "mpld3 — Bringing Matplotlib to the Browser", "description": "\nContents\n          ::  \n        Quick Start Guide  »\n        ", "url": "https://mpld3.github.io", "hostname": "mpld3.github.io", "category": "site", "item_id": 19748081, "item_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19748081", "root_id": 19737227, "original_title": null}, {"title": "HoloViews â 1.11.3", "description": "Stop plotting your data - annotate your data and let it visualize itself.", "url": "http://holoviews.org", "hostname": "holoviews.org", "category": "site", "item_id": 19745774, "item_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19745774", "root_id": 19737227, "original_title": null}, {"title": "Altair: Declarative Visualization in Python — Altair 2.4.1 documentation", "description": "Altair is a declarative statistical visualization library for Python, based on\nVega and Vega-Lite, and the source is available on\nGitHub.", "url": "https://altair-viz.github.io", "hostname": "altair-viz.github.io", "category": "site", "item_id": 19745774, "item_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19745774", "root_id": 19737227, "original_title": null}, {"title": "Plotly for Python", "description": "Create interactive, D3 and WebGL charts in Python.
