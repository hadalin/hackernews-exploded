Supporting farmers to monitor soil health could help to achieve the policy aspiration of sustainable soils by 2030 in England; however, little is known about how to overcome participation barriers, appropriate methodologies (practical, cost-effective, usefulness) or training needs. This paper presents the results from a pilot #60minworms study which mobilised farmers to assess over >1300 ha farmland soils in spring 2018. The results interpretation framework is based on the presence of earthworms from each of the three ecological groups at each observation (20 x 20 cm x 20 cm pit) and spatially across a field (10 soil pits). Results showed that most fields have basic earthworm presence and abundance, but 42% fields may be over-worked as indicated by absence/rarity of epigeic and/or anecic earthworms. Tillage had a negative impact (p < 0.05) on earthworm populations and organic matter management did not mitigate tillage impacts. In terms of farmer participation, Twitter and Farmers Weekly magazine were highly effective channels for recruitment. Direct feedback from participants included excellent scores in trust, value and satisfaction of the protocol (e.g. 100% would do the test again) and 57% would use their worm survey results to change their soil management practices. A key training need in terms of earthworm identification skills was reported. The trade-off between data quality, participation rates and fieldwork costs suggests there is potential to streamline the protocol further to #30minworms (5 pits), incurring farmer fieldwork costs of approximately £1.48 ha-1. At national scales, £14 million pounds across 4.7 M ha-1 in fieldwork costs per survey could be saved by farmer participation.", "url": "https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0203909", "hostname": "journals.plos.org", "category": "uncategorized", "comment_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19242130"}, {"title": "ICANN Calls for Full DNSSEC Deployment, Promotes Community Collaboration to Protect the Internet", "description": "LOS ANGELES – 21 February 2019 – The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) believes that there is an ongoing and significant risk to key parts of the Domain Name System (DNS)...", "url": "https://www.icann.org/news/announcement-2019-02-22-en", "hostname": "www.icann.org", "category": "uncategorized", "comment_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19239940"}, {"title": "A Deep Dive on the Recent Widespread DNS Hijacking Attacks —  Krebs on Security", "description": "The U.S. government — along with a number of leading security companies — recently warned about a series of highly complex and widespread attacks that allowed suspected Iranian hackers to siphon huge volumes of email passwords and other sensitive data from multiple governments and private companies.

A small\ncommercial VPN provider approached me recently about the fact they could see\nthe allowed IPs mapping easily with WireGuard, whereas with OpenVPN it was\nhidden deep inside a process they didn't know how to debug. \"Great,\" I\nthought. Not so fast. They were concerned that when compelled to retrieve this\nkind of information, they would no longer be able to claim, \"we don't know\nhow,\" since WireGuard makes it so easy. So, they hired me for a day to develop\nand open source a small solution for their unique use case and odd scenario.\n\nBefore reading further, do you have the same bizarre requirement? Probably\nnot. In that likely case, please keep reading only under the scope of,\n\"something somebody else thought they needed, but I don't need myself.\" In\nother words, don't use this code.\n\nNot wanting to hack up WireGuard or add configuration nobs -- or really\ncompromise any of what the project is about in response to these kinds of\nrequests -- I thought I'd write a small \"defensive rootkit,\" which most\ncertainly kills both your kitten and your neighbor's parrot.\n\nIt started out by just hooking the Netlink API to zero out the endpoints and\nallowedips for each peer. Then I disabled tcpdump. Then I disabled /dev/mem,\n/dev/kmem, /dev/port, /proc/kcore, and module loading. Things were looking\nfairly clean, until I needed to add compatibility support for old kernels, and\nthen I reverted to some cthulhu-style x86 opcode parsing and writing to proc\nfrom kernelspace and other atrocities. It seems to work relatively well on\nthe kernels I've tested, but of course there are no guarantees with this kind\nof stuff. In any case, there aren't very many public rootkit examples like\nthis, so at the very least it might be an aid to a college freshman doing an\nassignment for his \"Intro to Computer Security\" course.\n\nKeep in mind that there are several ways to subvert each and every defense\nthat this thing introduces. Several ways! All of the defenses! Subverted! For\nthat reason, you shouldn't use this if you're relying on the impossibility of\nsubversion. It's only meant as a confinement based on your own lack of\nknowledge on how to subvert it. As you learn more, the software becomes less\neffective.\n\nIf it's of any interest, it's online here:\nhttps://git.zx2c4.com/blind-operator-mode/about/\nhttps://git.zx2c4.com/blind-operator-mode/tree/blind-operator-mode.c\n$ git clone https://git.zx2c4.com/blind-operator-mode/\n\nEnjoy!
