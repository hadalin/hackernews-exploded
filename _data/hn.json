In cases where the parties disagree on what the law is, a common law court looks to past precedential decisions of relevant courts, and synthesizes the principles of those past cases as applicable to the current facts.  If a similar dispute has been resolved in the past, the court is usually bound to follow the reasoning used in the prior decision (a principle known as stare decisis). If, however, the court finds that the current dispute is fundamentally distinct from all previous cases (called a \"matter of first impression\"), and legislative statutes are either silent or ambiguous on the question, judges have the authority and duty to resolve the issue (one party or the other has to win, and on disagreements of law, judges make that decision).[7] The court states an opinion that gives reasons for the decision, and those reasons agglomerate with past decisions as precedent to bind future judges and litigants. Common law, as the body of law made by judges,[3][8] stands in contrast to and on equal footing with statutes which are adopted through the legislative process, and regulations which are promulgated by the executive branch (the interactions among these different sources of law are explained later in this article).  Stare decisis, the principle that cases should be decided according to consistent principled rules so that similar facts will yield similar results, lies at the heart of all common law systems.[9]\n", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_law#Common_law_legal_systems_as_opposed_to_civil_law_legal_systems", "hostname": "en.wikipedia.org", "category": "wiki_article", "comment_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19213599"}, {"title": "Stop that!

In a U.S. historical context, the phrase 'Corporate Personhood' refers to the ongoing legal debate over the extent to which rights traditionally associated with natural persons should also be afforded to corporations. A headnote issued by the Court Reporter in the 1886 Supreme Court case Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad Co. claimed to state the sense of the Court regarding the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment as it applies to corporations, without the Court having actually made a decision or issued a written opinion on that point. This was the first time that the Supreme Court was reported to hold that the Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection clause granted constitutional protections to corporations as well as to natural persons, although numerous other cases, since Dartmouth College v. Woodward in 1819, had recognized that corporations were entitled to some of the protections of the Constitution. In Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. (2014), the Court found that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 exempted Hobby Lobby from aspects of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act because those aspects placed a substantial burden on the closely held company's owners' exercise of free religion.[2]\n", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_personhood", "hostname": "en.wikipedia.org", "category": "wiki_article", "comment_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19212031"}, {"title": "Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act - Wikipedia", "description": "The Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act of 1980 (FIRPTA), enacted as Subtitle C of Title XI (the \"Revenue Adjustments Act of 1980\") of the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1980, Pub.

We think bamboo is pretty amazing and is worthy of our appreciation. We also have other&nbsp;wood sunglasses Here are some cool things to know about the strength of bamboo.&nbsp;\r\n\t1. Bamboo Is Strong:&nbsp;\r\n\tWhen compared to wood, bamboo fiber is 2-3 times stronger than timber. &nbsp;Maple wood is one of the densest and strongest hardwoods, yet bamboo is stronger while still being quite a bit lighter.\r\n\tIn Hong Kong, bamboo's abundance, incredibly strong structure, and light weight combine to make it perfect to be used as \r\n\tscaffolding in the construction of skyscrapers. Check it out:&nbsp;\r\n\t&nbsp; &nbsp;\r\n\t\r\n\tHow It Works did a fantastic video that talks about bamboo scaffolding used in Hong Kong. See how it is used here:\r\n\t\r\n\t2. Bamboo's Strength Comes From Being Hard\r\n\tFortius Bamboo is 122% harder than Tasmanian Oak and out performs just about every wood in the market. It is no wonder that in addition to scaffolding, it is being used for flooring, walls, decking, plywood, fencing and more.&nbsp;\r\n\tThe scale below how bamboo and these other woods performed on the Janka hardness test that measures the resistance of wood to denting and wear. &nbsp;and 11.28 mm (.444 inch) steel ball into the wood to half of the ball's diameter. Turns out, it takes 3,000 pounds of force to achieve this with Fortius Bamboo.&nbsp;\r\n\t\r\n\t3. In Some Ways Bamboo Cable is Stronger Than Steel\r\n\tThe tensile strength of plaited bamboo cables is as strong as or stronger than a steel cable of the same size. Hemp rope loses 20% of its strength when wet while bamboo cables increase in strength by as much as 20% when wet. In fact, in South America,&nbsp;bamboo is referred to as vegetable steel.\r\n\tThe longest bamboo suspension bridge was built across the Min-chiang River in China, and was built over 1000 years ago. &nbsp;While it was damaged, ferry boats were used, then in 1803 the bridge was rebuilt. The bridge was 850 feet long, 9 feet wide and supported by 10 woven bamboo cables 6 inches in diameter. Pretty crazy a bamboo bridge could span nearly 900 feet!! &nbsp;Quite the feat. &nbsp;(In 1974 the bridge was replaced by a steel cable bridge.)\r\n\tHere is a video of a failure test of a connector for bamboo structures. It finally fails at 57.6 kN which translates to about 5.8 tons of force. That is roughly 13,000 pounds of force! The breaking point happens at 1:50 into the video.\r\nThis is just the tip of the iceberg for bamboo. We will continue to post about the awesomeness of bamboo, so be sure to check back later!
