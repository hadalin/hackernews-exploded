This interval is the quantity of interest, since proper time itself is fixed only up to an arbitrary additive constant, namely the setting of the clock at some event along the world line. The proper time interval between two events depends not only on the events but also the world line connecting them, and hence on the motion of the clock between the events. It is expressed as an integral over the world line. An accelerated clock will measure a smaller elapsed time between two events than that measured by a non-accelerated (inertial) clock between the same two events.

The code construction is based on a multiple recursive concatenation of a short kernel code which transforms the physical channel into virtual outer channels. When the number of recursions becomes large, the virtual channels tend to either have high reliability or low reliability (in other words, they polarize), and the data bits are allocated to the most reliable channels. Polar codes were described by Erdal Arıkan in 2009.[1] There is work suggesting this is equivalent to an earlier optimised code for bitwise multistage decoding,[2] a code originally described by Norbert Stolte.[3][4] It is the first code with an explicit construction to provably achieve the channel capacity for symmetric binary-input, discrete, memoryless channels (B-DMC) with polynomial dependence on the gap to capacity.

The American mathematician Richard Hamming pioneered this field in the 1940s and invented the first error-correcting code in 1950: the Hamming (7,4) code.[2]\nThe redundancy allows the receiver to detect a limited number of errors that may occur anywhere in the message, and often to correct these errors without retransmission. ECC gives the receiver the ability to correct errors without needing a reverse channel to request retransmission of data, but at the cost of a fixed, higher forward channel bandwidth. ECC is therefore applied in situations where retransmissions are costly or impossible, such as one-way communication links and when transmitting  to multiple receivers in multicast. For example, in the case of a satellite orbiting around Uranus, a retransmission because of decoding errors can create a delay of 5 hours. ECC information is usually added to mass storage devices to enable recovery of corrupted data, is widely used in modems, and is used on systems where the primary memory is ECC memory.\n", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_correction_code", "hostname": "en.wikipedia.org", "category": "wiki_article", "item_id": 19248788, "item_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19248788", "root_id": 19247633, "original_title": null}, {"title": "Clock recovery - Wikipedia", "description": "In serial communication of digital data, clock recovery is the process of extracting timing information from a serial data stream to allow the receiving circuit to decode the transmitted symbols.

identifies three ways to traverse a binary tree.\nIt’s not entirely clear how to generalize them to k-ary trees,\nand I recently noticed an unexpected ordering that I’d like to know more about.\nIf you know of references to this ordering, please leave a comment\nor email me (rsc@swtch.com).\nBinary Tree Orderings\n\nFirst a refresher about binary-tree orderings\nto set up an analogy to k-ary trees.\n\n\nPreorder visits a node before its left and right subtrees:\n\n\n\n\nInorder visits a node between its left and right subtrees:\n\n\n\n\nPostorder visits a node after its left and right subtrees:\n\n\n\n\nEach picture shows the same 16-leaf, 31-node binary tree, with the nodes\nnumbered and also placed horizontally using the order\nvisited in the given traversal.\n\n\nIt was observed long ago that one way to represent a tree\nin linear storage is to record the nodes in a fixed order\n(such as one of these), along with a separate array giving\nthe number of children of each node.\nIn the pictures, the trees are complete, balanced trees, so the\nnumber of children of each node can be derived from\nthe number of total leaves.\n(For more, see Knuth Volume 1 §2.3.1;\nfor references, see §2.3.1.6, and §2.6.)\n\n\nIt is convenient to refer to nodes in a tree by\na two-dimensional coordinate (l, n), consisting of the level of\nthe node (with 0 being the leaves) and its sequence number at that level.\nFor example, the root of the 16-node tree has coordinate (4, 0),\nwhile the leaves are (0, 0) through (0, 15).\n\n\nWhen storing a tree using a linearized ordering such as these,\nit is often necessary to be able to convert a two-dimensional\ncoordinate to its index in the linear ordering.\nFor example,\nthe right child of the root—node (3, 1)—has\nnumber 16, 23, and 29\nin the three different orderings.\n\n\nThe linearized pre-ordering of (l, n) is given by:\n\nseq(L, 0) = 0 (L is height of tree)\nseq(l, n) = seq(l+1, n/2) + 1 (n even)\nseq(l, n) = seq(l+1, n/2) + 2l+1 (n odd)\n\nThis ordering is awkward because it changes depending on the height of the tree.\n\n\nThe linearized post-ordering of (l, n) is given by:\n\nseq(0, n) = n + n/2 + n/4 + n/8 + ...\nseq(l, n) = seq(l–1, 2 n + 1) + 1 = seq(0, 2l n + 2l – 1) + l\n\nThis ordering is independent of the height of the tree,\nbut the leaf numbering is still a little complex.\n\n\nThe linearized in-ordering is much more regular.\nIt’s clear just looking at it that seq(0, n) = 2 n,\nand in fact a single equation applies to all levels:\n\nseq(l, n) = 2l+1 n + 2l – 1\n\nIf you need to linearize a complete binary tree,\nusing the in-order traversal has the simplest math.\nk-ary Tree Orderings\n\nThe three binary orderings\ncorrespond to visiting the node after 0, 1, or 2 of\nits child subtrees.\nTo generalize to k-ary trees,\nwe can visit the node after any number\nof subtrees from 0 to k,\nproducing k+1 orderings.\nFor example, for k = 3,\nhere are the four generalized orderings\nof a 27-leaf, 39-node 3-ary tree:\n\n\nPreorder (inorder-0):\n\n\n\n\nInorder-1:\n\n\n\n\nInorder-2:\n\n\n\n\nPostorder (inorder-3):\n\n\n\n\nJust looking at the leaves of each, none of them\nhas a nice simple form with regular gaps\nlike the seq(0, n) = 2 n of in-order traversal\nfor binary trees.\nInstead, both the possible “in-order” traversals\nend up with equations more like the post-order traversal.\nWhat happened?\nWhere did the nice, regular pattern go?\nAn Unexpected Ordering\n\nIn a binary tree, the in-order numbering has the property that\nafter the first leaf, one new parent (non-leaf) node is introduced\nbefore each additional one leaf.\nThis works out nicely because the number of parent nodes in a binary\ntree of N leaves is N–1.\nThe number of parents nodes in a k-ary tree of N leaves is\n(N–1)/(k–1),\nso we could try to build a nicer numbering\nby,\nafter the first leaf,\nintroducing one new parent node\nbefore each additional k–1 leaf nodes.\nThat is, the leaves would be numbered by\n\nseq(0, n) = n + (n+k–2)/(k–1),\n\nwhich gives this leaf structure:\n\n\n\n\nBut how do we fill in the gaps?\nThe first three triples—0, 2, 3 and 5, 6, 8 and 9, 11, 12—clearly\nget nodes 1, 4, 7, and 10 as their three parents and one grandparent,\nbut which is the grandparent?\nThe binary in-order traversal was very self-similar,\nso let’s try the same thing here:\nafter the first node,\nreserve one node for higher levels\nbefore each k–1 nodes at this level.\nThat is, the parents are 1, 7, 10,\nand the grandparent is 4.\n\n\nApplying this process throughout the tree,\nwe end up with this traversal order (inorder-G, for gap-induced):\n\n\n\n\nFor contrast, here is the ordering from the previous section\nthat visited each node after its first subtree (inorder-1):\n\n\n\n\nThe inorder-1 traversal has a regular tree structure but irregular numbering.\nIn contrast, the inorder-G traversal has an irregular tree structure but very\nregular numbering that generalizes the binary inorder numbering:\n\nseq(l, n) = kl (n+k–2)/(k–1) + kl-1 + kl-2 + ... + k0\n\nFor a binary tree, inorder-1 and inorder-G are the same:\nthe traversal has both a regular tree structure and a regular numbering.\nBut for k-ary trees, it seems you can pick only one.\n\n\nThe regularity of the numbering is easiest to see in base k.\nFor example, here is the binary inorder traversal with binary numbering:\n\n\n\n\nThe bottom row uses numbers ending in 0;\nthe next row up uses numbers ending in 01;\nthen 011; and so on.\n\n\nFor the 3-ary tree, it is the inorder-G traversal (not inorder-1 or inorder-2) that produces an equivalent pattern:\n\n\n\n\nThe bottom row uses numbers ending in 0 or 2;\nthe next row up uses numbers ending in 01 or 21;\nthen 011 or 211; and so on.\nThe general rule is that\n\nseq(l, n) = ((n+k–2)/(k–1))k || (1)kl\n\nwhere (x)k means x written as a base-k number,\n|| denotes concatenation of base-k numbers,\nand\n(1)kl\nmeans the base-k digit 1 repeated l times.\n\n\nThrough a roundabout way, then, we’ve ended up with a\ntree traversal that’s really just a nice base-k encoding.\nThere must be existing uses of this encoding,\nbut I’ve been unable to find any or even determine what its name is.\nFurther Reading?\n\nDoes anyone know of any places this has appeared before? I’d love to read about them.

Like a B-tree, a fractal tree index is a generalization of a binary search tree in that a node can have more than two children.  Furthermore, unlike a B-tree, a fractal tree index has buffers at each node, which allow insertions, deletions and other changes to be stored in intermediate locations.  The goal of the buffers is to schedule disk writes so that each write performs a large amount of useful work, thereby avoiding the worst-case performance of B-trees, in which each disk write may change a small amount of data on disk.   Like a B-tree, fractal tree indexes are optimized for systems that read and write large blocks of data.  The fractal tree index has been commercialized in databases by Tokutek.  Originally, it was implemented as a cache-oblivious lookahead array,[1] but the current implementation is an extension of the Bε tree.[2]  The Bε is related to the Buffered Repository Tree.[3]  The Buffered Repository Tree has degree 2, whereas the  Bε tree has degree  Bε.  The fractal tree index has also been used in a prototype filesystem.[4][5] An open source implementation of the fractal tree index is available,[6] which demonstrates the implementation details outlined below.\n", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal_tree_index", "hostname": "en.wikipedia.org", "category": "wiki_article", "item_id": 19248139, "item_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19248139", "root_id": 19247538, "original_title": null}, {"title": "Data is in the eye of the beholder – Topics in Sustainable Fisheries", "description": "Sustainable Fisheries", "url": "https://sites.uw.edu/bevanseries/2018/02/28/data-is-in-the-eye-of-the-beholder/", "hostname": "sites.uw.edu", "category": "uncategorized", "item_id": 19244051, "item_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19244051", "root_id": null, "original_title": "Data is in the eye of the beholder"}, {"title": "Huawei Frightens Europe's Data Protectors.
