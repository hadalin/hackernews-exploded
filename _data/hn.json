Additional works, including two novels, two novellas, and two short story collections, were published posthumously.

In the fall of 2002,\none was created to teach operating systems engineering.  In the course lectures,\nthe class worked through Sixth Edition Unix (aka V6) using\nJohn Lions's famous commentary.  In the lab assignments, students wrote most of\nan exokernel operating system, eventually named Jos, for the Intel x86.\nExposing students to multiple systems–V6 and Jos–helped develop a\nsense of the spectrum of operating system designs.\n\n\nV6 presented pedagogic challenges from the start.\nStudents doubted the relevance of an obsolete 30-year-old operating system\nwritten in an obsolete programming language (pre-K&R C)\nrunning on obsolete hardware (the PDP-11).\nStudents also struggled to learn the low-level details of two different\narchitectures (the PDP-11 and the Intel x86) at the same time.\nBy the summer of 2006, we had decided to replace V6\nwith a new operating system, xv6, modeled on V6\nbut written in ANSI C and running on multiprocessor\nIntel x86 machines.\nXv6's use of the x86 makes it more relevant to\nstudents' experience than V6 was\nand unifies the course around a single architecture.\nAdding multiprocessor support requires handling concurrency head on with\nlocks and threads (instead of using special-case solutions for\nuniprocessors such as\nenabling/disabling interrupts) and helps relevance.\nFinally, writing a new system allowed us to write cleaner versions\nof the rougher parts of V6, like the scheduler and file system.\n6.828 substituted xv6 for V6 in the fall of 2006. \n\nXv6 sources and text\n\nThe latest xv6 source and text are available via\ngit clone git://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-public.git\nand\ngit clone git://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-book.git\nWe also distribute the sources as a printed booklet with line numbers\nthat keep everyone together during lectures.  The booklet is available as xv6-rev11.pdf,\nalong with a commentary/textbook. The line numbers in this commentary/book refer to the source booklet.\n\nxv6 compiles using the GNU C compiler,\ntargeted at the x86 using ELF binaries.\nOn BSD and Linux systems, you can use the native compilers;\nOn OS X, which doesn't use ELF binaries,\nyou must use a cross-compiler.\nXv6 does boot on real hardware, but typically\nwe run it using the QEMU emulator.\nBoth the GCC cross compiler and QEMU\ncan be found on the 6.828 tools page.\n\nXv6 lecture material\n\nIn 6.828, the lectures in the first half of the course cover the xv6 sources and\ntext.  The lectures in the second half consider advanced topics using research\npapers; for some, xv6 serves as a useful base for making discussions concrete.\nThe lecture notes are available from the 6.828 schedule page.\n\nXv6 homeworks\n\nThe Xv6 homeworks consist of small programming exercises that extend xv6 in\ninteresting ways.

The inflation-adjusted wage of a US worker today is less than 40 years ago—but there are four times as many multimillionaires. As inequality grows, the infrastructure frays and the politics become more poisonous. Every year, more and more Americans go on shooting sprees, killing strangers and passers-by—and now, increasingly, the representatives of the state. Troubling trends of this kind are endlessly discussed by politicians, public intellectuals, and social scientists. But mostly, they talk about only a small slice of the overall problem. After all, how on earth can yet another murderous rampage have anything to do with polarization in Congress? And is there really a connection between too many multimillionaires and government gridlock? Historical analysis shows that long spells of equitable prosperity and internal peace are succeeded by protracted periods of inequity, increasing misery, and political instability. These crisis periods—“Ages of Discord”—tend to share characteristic features, identifiable in many societies throughout history. Modern Americans, for example, may be disconcerted to learn that the US right now has much in common with the Antebellum 1850s and, even more surprisingly, with ancien régime France on the eve of the French Revolution. Can it really be true that our troubled age is nothing new, and that it arises periodically for similar underlying reasons? It can. Ages of Discord marshals a cohesive theory and detailed historical data to show that this is, indeed, the case. The book takes the reader on a roller-coaster ride through American history, from the Era of Good Feelings of the 1820s to our first Age of Discord, which culminated in the American Civil War, to post-WW2 prosperity and, finally, to our present, second Age of Discord. Unlike societies in the past, however, we are in a unique position to take steps to escape the worst. Societal breakdown and the ensuing wave of violence can be avoided by taking collective, cooperative action. The structural-demographic theory, explained in this book, helps us understand why demographic, social, and political trends changed direction from favorable to unfavorable in America around the 1970s. Such understanding is the key to developing reforms that would reverse these negative trends and move us to a more equitable, prosperous, and peaceful society.

His theories parallel many other theories of human developmental psychology, some of which focus on describing the stages of growth in humans. He then decided to create a classification system which reflected the universal needs of society as its base and then proceeding to more acquired emotions.[3] Maslow's hierarchy of needs is used to study how humans intrinsically partake in behavioral motivation. Maslow used the terms \"physiological,\" \"safety,\" \"belonging and love,\" or \"social needs\" \"esteem,\" and \"self-actualization\" to describe the pattern through which human motivations generally move. This means that in order for motivation to occur at the next level, each level must be satisfied within the individual themselves. Furthermore, this theory is a key foundation in understanding how drive and motivation are correlated when discussing human behavior. Each of these individual levels contains a certain amount of internal sensation that must be met in order for an individual to complete their hierarchy.[3]The goal of Maslow's Theory is to attain the fifth level or stage: self-actualization.[4]", "url": "https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs", "hostname": "en.m.wikipedia.org", "category": "wiki_article", "comment_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19231635"}, {"title": "Bloomberg - Are you a robot?", "description": "To continue, please click the box below to let us know you're not a robot.", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/tosv2.html?vid=&uuid=c2b42870-3732-11e9-b9d1-d7a0efe8bea7&url=L25ld3MvYXJ0aWNsZXMvMjAxOC0wOS0yMS9tYWdpYy1sZWFwLWlzLWJpZGRpbmctb24tYW4tYXJteS1jb21iYXQtY29udHJhY3Q=", "hostname": "www.bloomberg.com", "category": "news", "comment_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19231426"}, {"title": "Z1 (computer) - Wikipedia", "description": "The Z1  was a mechanical computer designed by Konrad Zuse from 1936 to 1937 and built by him from 1936 to 1938.[1][2] It was a binary electrically driven mechanical calculator with limited programmability, reading instructions from punched celluloid film.\n", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z1_(computer)", "hostname": "en.wikipedia.org", "category": "wiki_article", "comment_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19231526"}, {"title": "ENIAC - Wikipedia", "description": "ENIAC (/ˈiːniæk, ˈɛ-/; Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer)[1][2] was amongst the earliest electronic general-purpose computers made.

We are alarmed that Microsoft is working to provide weapons technology to the U.S. Military, helping one country's government \"increase lethality\" using tools we built. We did not sign up to develop weapons, and we demand a say in how our work is used.\n\nIn November, Microsoft was awarded the $479 million Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS) contract with the United States Department of the Army. The contract's stated objective is to \"rapidly develop, test, and manufacture a single platform that Soldiers can use to Fight, Rehearse, and Train that provides increased lethality, mobility, and situational awareness necessary to achieve overmatch against our current and future adversaries.\". Microsoft intends to apply its HoloLens augmented reality technology to this purpose. While the company has previously licensed tech to the U.S. Military, it has never crossed the line into weapons development. With this contract, it does. The application of HoloLens within the IVAS system is designed to help people kill. It will be deployed on the battlefield, and works by turning warfare into a simulated \"video game,\" further distancing soldiers from the grim stakes of war and the reality of bloodshed.\n\nIntent to harm is not an acceptable use of our technology.\n\nWe demand that Microsoft:\n\n    1) Cancel the IVAS contract;\n\n    2) Cease developing any and all weapons technologies, and draft a public-facing acceptable use policy clarifying this commitment;\n\n    3) Appoint an independent, external ethics review board with the power to enforce and publicly validate compliance with its acceptable use policy.\n\nAlthough a review process exists for ethics in AI, AETHER, it is opaque to Microsoft workers, and clearly not robust enough to prevent weapons development, as the IVAS contract demonstrates. Without such a policy, Microsoft fails to inform its engineers on the intent of the software they are building. Such a policy would also enable workers and the public to hold Microsoft accountable.\n\nBrad Smith’s suggestion that employees concerned about working on unethical projects \"would be allowed to move to other work within the company\" ignores the problem that workers are not properly informed of the use of their work. There are many engineers who contributed to HoloLens before this contract even existed, believing it would be used to help architects and engineers build buildings and cars, to help teach people how to perform surgery or play the piano, to push the boundaries of gaming, and to connect with the Mars Rover (RIP). These engineers have now lost their ability to make decisions about what they work on, instead finding themselves implicated as war profiteers.\n\nMicrosoft's guidelines on accessibility and security go above and beyond because we care about our customers. We ask for the same approach to a policy on ethics and acceptable use of our technology. Making our products accessible to all audiences has required us to be proactive and unwavering about inclusion. If we don't make the same commitment to be ethical, we won't be. We must design against abuse and the potential to cause violence and harm.\n\nMicrosoft's mission is to empower every person and organization on the planet to do more. But implicit in that statement, we believe it is also Microsoft's mission to empower every person and organization on the planet to do good. We also need to be mindful of who we're empowering and what we're empowering them to do. Extending this core mission to encompass warfare and disempower Microsoft employees, is disingenuous, as \"every person\" also means empowering us. As employees and shareholders we do not want to become war profiteers. To that end, we believe that Microsoft must stop in its activities to empower the U.S. Army's ability to cause harm and violence.\n\nMicrosoft Workers", "url": "https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=v4j5cvGGr0GRqy180BHbR8FphOYvOmpEuyqtBwL-mE9URTZFWkRRWDFUUUw3SktUMUhKMFVTTUZSTC4u", "hostname": "forms.office.com", "category": "uncategorized", "comment_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19229948"}, {"title": "William James - The Moral Equivalent of War", "description": null, "url": "https://www.uky.edu/~eushe2/Pajares/moral.html", "hostname": "www.uky.edu", "category": "uncategorized", "comment_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19230149"}, {"title": "A chilling new post-traumatic stress disorder: Why drone pilots are quitting in record numbers", "description": "A raft of data suggest our remote-controlled war games are taking a steep psychological toll on their players", "url": "https://www.salon.com/2015/03/06/a_chilling_new_post_traumatic_stress_disorder_why_drone_pilots_are_quitting_in_record_numbers_partner/", "hostname": "www.salon.com", "category": "uncategorized", "comment_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19230183"}, {"title": "'What Every Person Should Know About War'", "description": "\"Of the past 3,400 years, humans have been entirely at peace for 268 of them, or just 8 percent of recorded history.\"", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/06/books/chapters/what-every-person-should-know-about-war.html", "hostname": "www.nytimes.com", "category": "news", "comment_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19230074"}, {"title": "Roma’s Wounding Confession | Church Life Journal", "description": "Joseph G.

Principally, the union sought to have actors and voice and motion capture artists that contribute to video games be better compensated with residuals based on video game sales atop their existing recording payments, while the industry companies asserted that the industry as a whole eschews the use of residuals, and by giving the actors these, they would trivialize the efforts of the programmers and artists that are most responsible for the development of the games. In exchange, the companies had offered a fixed increase in rates and a sliding-scale upfront bonus for multiple recording sessions, which the union had rejected.
