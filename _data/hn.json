Supporting farmers to monitor soil health could help to achieve the policy aspiration of sustainable soils by 2030 in England; however, little is known about how to overcome participation barriers, appropriate methodologies (practical, cost-effective, usefulness) or training needs. This paper presents the results from a pilot #60minworms study which mobilised farmers to assess over >1300 ha farmland soils in spring 2018. The results interpretation framework is based on the presence of earthworms from each of the three ecological groups at each observation (20 x 20 cm x 20 cm pit) and spatially across a field (10 soil pits). Results showed that most fields have basic earthworm presence and abundance, but 42% fields may be over-worked as indicated by absence/rarity of epigeic and/or anecic earthworms. Tillage had a negative impact (p < 0.05) on earthworm populations and organic matter management did not mitigate tillage impacts. In terms of farmer participation, Twitter and Farmers Weekly magazine were highly effective channels for recruitment. Direct feedback from participants included excellent scores in trust, value and satisfaction of the protocol (e.g. 100% would do the test again) and 57% would use their worm survey results to change their soil management practices. A key training need in terms of earthworm identification skills was reported. The trade-off between data quality, participation rates and fieldwork costs suggests there is potential to streamline the protocol further to #30minworms (5 pits), incurring farmer fieldwork costs of approximately £1.48 ha-1. At national scales, £14 million pounds across 4.7 M ha-1 in fieldwork costs per survey could be saved by farmer participation.", "url": "https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0203909", "hostname": "journals.plos.org", "category": "uncategorized", "comment_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19242103"}, {"title": "My Twitch Live Coding Setup – Suz Hinton – Medium", "description": "This article is an updated review of tools and software that I use to run my live coding stream each Sunday.

It was initially recognized as a clinical \"wasting\" syndrome and then in 1978, it was identified more specifically as a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE). Since then, CWD has spread to free-ranging and captive animal populations in 26 US states and three Canadian provinces.[3] CWD is typified by chronic weight loss leading to death.

In this groundbreaking book, Nancy Leveson proposes a new approach to safety—more suited to today's complex, sociotechnical, software-intensive world—based on modern systems thinking and systems theory. Revisiting and updating ideas pioneered by 1950s aerospace engineers in their System Safety concept, and testing her new model extensively on real-world examples, Leveson has created a new approach to safety that is more effective, less expensive, and easier to use than current techniques.Arguing that traditional models of causality are inadequate, Leveson presents a new, extended model of causation (Systems-Theoretic Accident Model and Processes, or STAMP), then shows how the new model can be used to create techniques for system safety engineering, including accident analysis, hazard analysis, system design, safety in operations, and management of safety-critical systems. She applies the new techniques to real-world events including the friendly-fire loss of a U.S. Blackhawk helicopter in the first Gulf War; the Vioxx recall; the U.S. Navy SUBSAFE program; and the bacterial contamination of a public water supply in a Canadian town. Leveson's approach is relevant even beyond safety engineering, offering techniques for “reengineering” any large sociotechnical system to improve safety and manage risk.", "url": "https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/engineering-safer-world", "hostname": "mitpress.mit.edu", "category": "uncategorized", "comment_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19239565"}, {"title": "They Write the Right Stuff", "description": "As the 120-ton space shuttle sits surrounded by almost 4 million pounds of rocket fuel, exhaling noxious fumes, visibly impatient to defy gravity, its on-board computers take command.\n", "url": "https://www.fastcompany.com/28121/they-write-right-stuff", "hostname": "www.fastcompany.com", "category": "uncategorized", "comment_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19239701"}, {"title": "What operating system(s) were used in the space shuttle?", "description": "Is there any possibility to learn and use the operating system languages used in the space shuttle?", "url": "https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/19006/what-operating-systems-were-used-in-the-space-shuttle", "hostname": "space.stackexchange.com", "category": "uncategorized", "comment_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19240426"}, {"title": "Software industry - Wikipedia", "description": "The software industry includes businesses  for development, maintenance and publication of software that are using different business models, mainly either \"license/maintenance based\" (on-premises) or \"Cloud based\" (such as SaaS, PaaS, IaaS, MaaS, AaaS, etc.).

Developing it wouldn’t require much effort—just a few days of an engineer’s time—but it was one of hundreds of ideas proposed, and the program managers deemed it a low priority. So it languished for more than six months, until an engineer, who saw that the cost of writing the code for it would be small, launched a simple online controlled experiment—an A/B test—to assess its impact. Within hours the new headline variation was producing abnormally high revenue, triggering a “too good to be true” alert. Usually, such alerts signal a bug, but not in this case. An analysis showed that the change had increased revenue by an astonishing 12%—which on an annual basis would come to more than $100 million in the United States alone—without hurting key user-experience metrics. It was the best revenue-generating idea in Bing’s history, but until the test its value was underappreciated.", "url": "http://blog.rootshell.ir/2019/02/how-to-increase-annual-revenue-by-50-million-using-online-experiments-methods-and-tricks/", "hostname": "blog.rootshell.ir", "category": "uncategorized", "comment_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19241985"}, {"title": "Curiosity rover gives NASA a scare, needed a reset", "description": "The internet mourned in early February as NASA confirmed that their Opportunity rover – affectionately known as Oppy – was no longer functioning, and the mission was declared over after an astonishingly successful 14 years on Mars.", "url": "https://www.techspot.com/news/78894-curiosity-rover-gives-nasa-scare-needed-reset.html", "hostname": "www.techspot.com", "category": "uncategorized", "comment_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19236349"}, {"title": "Is Shared Database in Microservices actually anti-pattern?", "description": "I used to work with several projects leveraging idea of microservices.
