That is, it takes an input\nfile of any size and outputs 20 bytes. An essential property of\ncryptographic hash functions is that in practice (though obviously not\nin theory), no two files should have the same hash value unless the files\nare identical.\n\nSHA-1 no longer has that property;\nwe've known that for about 15 years.\nBut definitions matter. SHA-1 is susceptible to a \"collision attack\":\nan attacker can simultaneously create two files that have the same\nSHA-1 hash. However, given an existing file and hence its hash, it is\nnot possible, as far as anyone knows, to generate a second file\nwith that same hash. This attack, called a \"pre-image attack\", is far\nmore serious. (There's a third type of attack, a \"second pre-image attack\",\nwhich I won't go into.)\n\nIn the ordinary sequence of events, someone at Microsoft prepares an update\nfile. Its hash—its SHA-1 hash, in many cases—is calculated; this value\nis then digitally signed. Someone who wished to create a fake update\nwould have to crack either the signature algorithm or, somehow, produce\na fake update that had the same hash value as the legitimate update.\nBut that's a pre-image attack, and SHA-1 is still believed to be secure\nagainst those. So: is this update useless? Not quite—there's still a\nrisk.\n\nRecall that SHA-1 is vulnerable to a collision attack. This means that\nif two updates are prepared simultaneously, one good and one evil, there\ncan be a signed, malicious update. In other words, the threat model here\nis a corrupt insider.\nBy eliminating use of SHA-1 for updates, Microsoft is protecting\nusers against misbehavior by one of its own employees.\n\nNow, perhaps this is just housekeeping. Microsoft can get SHA-1 out of\nits code base, and thus discourage its use.

More information about reproducible builds in general are available at reproducible-builds.org.   \n\n  \nAbout \n \nMake a package reproducible \n \nHow to help \n \nExperimental toolchain \n\n  \nProject history \n \nSalsa project \n \nBug reports \n \nContinuous integration \n\n\nStatus\nReproducible builds of Debian as a whole is still not a reality, though individual reproducible builds of packages are possible and being done. So while we are making very good progress, it is a stretch to say that Debian is reproducible. Most packages built in sid today are reproducible under a fixed build-path and environment. We have a new control file *.buildinfo that records the build environment, see deb-buildinfo for reference. Older design drafts are here. We have a continuous integration platform that builds and immediately rebuilds packages. With this we can detect problems related to timestamps, file ordering, CPU usage, (pseudo-)randomness and other things. We are examining packages and sorting out common problems. Many patches have already been submitted, and we are continuously writing new ones. You can check which packages installed on your system are still unreproducible by using the reproducible-check script in the devscripts package. \nBig outstanding issues\nThese are the critical items necessary to have reproducible builds for at least the required packages of Debian #763822: ftp.debian.org: please include .buildinfo file in the archive, with this two related bugs:  #862073: ftp.debian.org: Please POST .buildinfo files to buildinfo.debian.net #862538: security.debian.org: Please POST .buildinfo files to buildinfo.debian.net #900918: debian-installer: Please make the generated images reproducible User-facing interfaces (see proof-of-concept in #863622: apt: warn when installing packages that are not reproducible #900837: Mass-rebuild of packages for reproducible builds currently debian-policy says \"packages should be reproducible\", though we aim for \"packages must be reproducible\" though it's still a long road until we'll be there: currently (Oct 2018) there are more than 1250 unreproducible packages in Buster, thus if policy would be changed today, 1250 packages would need to be kicked out of Buster (well, or fixed) immediatly, so this policy change right now is not feasable. \nAnnoying but not major\n#869184: dpkg: source uploads including _amd64.buildinfo cause problems #802241: dpkg: please store the hash of the installed .deb and allow to query it #894441: binNMUs should be replaced by easy \"no-change-except-debian/changelog-uploads\" \nNice to have\nTighten up the Policy definition of \"reproducible\" to be stricter about environment variables and build paths. Discuss which environment variables we should blacklist or whitelist, 876055. There are many other possible nice-to-haves, e.g., making builds independent of their build directory, making it possible to create archive formats (like tar.gz and zip) with different tools yet result in the same byte order, etc.  Many of those are valuable, but they shouldn't distract from getting the results of reproducible builds out to users. \nNext\nFor more concrete tasks to be done, look at how to contribute.

Like Lisp, Julia represents its own code as a data structure of the language itself. Since code is represented by objects that can be created and manipulated from within the language, it is possible for a program to transform and generate its own code. This allows sophisticated code generation without extra build steps, and also allows true Lisp-style macros operating at the level of abstract syntax trees. In contrast, preprocessor \"macro\" systems, like that of C and C++, perform textual manipulation and substitution before any actual parsing or interpretation occurs. Because all data types and code in Julia are represented by Julia data structures, powerful reflection capabilities are available to explore the internals of a program and its types just like any other data.", "url": "https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/metaprogramming/", "hostname": "docs.julialang.org", "category": "uncategorized", "comment_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19206888"}, {"title": "The role of femtolisp in Julia?", "description": "Hii Julians,  I was wondering about the exact usage of femtolisp in julia.
