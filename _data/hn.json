The  most\n  often  cited  papers   (well  worth  reading)  are  a  strong  critique   by\n  Habermann(8) and an  equally strong rejoinder by Lecarme and  Desjardins.(9)\n  The  paper  by  Boom and  DeJong(10)  is  also  good  reading.  Wirth's  own\n  assessment  of Pascal  is found  in [11].  I have  no desire  or ability  to\n  summarize the  literature; this  paper represents  my personal  observations\n  and most of  it necessarily duplicates points  made by others.  I have  tried\n  to organize the rest of the material around the issues of\n\n\ntypes and scope\ncontrol flow\nenvironment\ncosmetics\n\n\n  and within each area more or less in decreasing order of significance.\n\n\n    To  state  my  conclusions at  the  outset:  Pascal may  be  an  admirable\n  language  for  teaching beginners  how  to  program; I  have  no  first-hand\n  experience with  that.  It was  a considerable  achievement for 1968.  It  has\n  certainly influenced the design of  recent languages, of which Ada is likely\n  to  be the  most  important.  But  in its  standard  form (both  current  and\n  proposed), Pascal is not adequate  for writing real programs.  It is suitable\n  only for small, self-contained programs  that have only trivial interactions\n  with their  environment and  that make  no use  of any  software written  by\n  anyone else.\n\n\n2.  Types and Scopes\n    Pascal  is  (almost) a  strongly  typed language.  Roughly speaking,  that\n  means  that  each  object  in  a  program  has  a  well-defined  type  which\n  implicitly defines  the legal values  of and  operations on the object.  The\n  language guarantees that it will  prohibit illegal values and operations, by\n  some mixture of compile- and  run-time checking.  Of course compilers may not\n  actually  do   all  the  checking   implied  in  the  language   definition.  \n  Furthermore, strong typing is not  to be confused with dimensional analysis.  \n  If one defines types 'apple' and 'orange' with\n\n\n     type\n             apple = integer;\n             orange = integer;\n\n\n  then any  arbitrary arithmetic  expression involving apples  and oranges  is\n  perfectly legal.\n    Strong  typing shows up in  a variety of ways.  For instance, arguments  to\n  functions and procedures  are checked for proper type matching.  Gone is  the\n  Fortran  freedom to  pass a  floating point  number into  a subroutine  that\n  expects an integer;  this I deem a  desirable attribute of Pascal, since  it\n  warns of a construction that will certainly cause an error.\n    Integer  variables may  be declared to have  an associated range of  legal\n  values, and the compiler  and run-time support ensure that one does not  put\n  large integers  into variables  that only  hold small ones.  This too  seems\n  like a service, although of course run-time checking does exact a penalty.\n    Let us move on to some problems of type and scope.\n\n\n2.1.  The size of an array is part of its type\n\n    If one declares\n\n\n     var     arr10 : array [1..10] of integer;\n             arr20 : array [1..20] of integer;\n\n\n  then arr10 and arr20 are  arrays of 10 and 20 integers respectively.  Suppose\n  we want to write a  procedure 'sort' to sort an integer array.  Because arr10\n  and  arr20 have  different  types, it  is not  possible  to write  a  single\n  procedure that will sort them both.\n\n    The  place where  this affects  Software Tools particularly,  and I  think\n  programs  in general,  is that  it  makes it  difficult indeed  to create  a\n  library  of  routines  for doing  common,  general-purpose  operations  like\n  sorting.\n\n    The  particular data type most  often affected is 'array of char', for  in\n  Pascal  a string  is an  array of  characters.  Consider  writing a  function\n  'index(s,c)'  that will  return  the  position in  the  string s  where  the\n  character c  first occurs, or  zero if  it does not.  The problem is how  to\n  handle  the string  argument of  'index'.  The  calls 'index('hello',c)'  and\n  'index('goodbye',c)' cannot both be legal,  since the strings have different\n  lengths.  (I pass over the  question of how the end of a constant string like\n  'hello' can be detected, because it can't.)\n    The next try is\n\n\n     var     temp : array [1..10] of char;\n     temp := 'hello';\n\n     n := index(temp,c);\n\n\n  but the assignment  to 'temp' is illegal  because 'hello' and 'temp' are  of\n  different lengths.\n\n    The  only  escape from  this infinite  regress is  to define  a family  of\n  routines  with a  member  for each  possible string  size,  or to  make  all\n  strings (including constant strings like 'define' ) of the same length.\n    The  latter approach is the lesser of two great  evils.  In 'Tools', a type\n  called 'string' is declared as\n\n\n     type    string = array [1..MAXSTR] of char;\n\n\n  where  the constant  'MAXSTR' is  ``big  enough,'' and  all  strings in  all\n  programs are exactly this size.  This is far from ideal, although it made it\n  possible to  get the  programs running.  It does  not solve  the problem  of\n  creating true libraries of useful routines.\n\n    There  are some situations  where it is simply  not acceptable to use  the\n  fixed-size array  representation.  For example,  the 'Tools' program to  sort\n  lines of text operates by  filling up memory with as many lines as will fit;\n  its running  time depends  strongly on how  full the memory  can be  packed.\n  Thus for 'sort', another representation  is used, a long array of characters\n  and a set of indices into this array:\n\n\n     type    charbuf = array [1..MAXBUF] of char;\n             charindex = array [1..MAXINDEX] of 0..MAXBUF;\n\n\n  But  the  procedures  and functions  written  to  process  the  fixed-length\n  representation cannot  be used  with the variable-length  form; an  entirely\n  new  set  of  routines  is needed  to  copy  and  compare  strings  in  this\n  representation.  In Fortran or C the same functions could be used for both.\n\n    As suggested above, a constant string is written as\n\n\n     'this is a string'\n\n\n  and has the type 'packed  array [1..n] of char', where n is the length.  Thus\n  each string literal  of different length has  a different type.  The only  way\n  to write  a routine that  will print  a message and clean  up is to pad  all\n  messages out to the same maximum length:\n\n\n     error('short message                    ');\n     error('this is a somewhat longer message');\n\n\n    Many  commercial  Pascal  compilers  provide  a 'string'  data  type  that\n  explicitly avoids the problem;  'string's are all taken to be the same  type\n  regardless of size.  This  solves the problem for this single data type,  but\n  no  other.  It  also fails  to solve  secondary problems  like computing  the\n  length  of  a  constant string;  another  built-in  function  is  the  usual\n  solution.\n\n    Pascal  enthusiasts often claim that  to cope with the array-size  problem\n  one merely has to copy  some library routine and fill in the parameters  for\n  the program at hand, but the defense sounds weak at best:(12)\n\n      ``Since  the bounds  of an  array are  part of  its type  (or, more\n      exactly, of  the type of its indexes), it is impossible to define a\n      procedure  or  function  which  applies  to  arrays with  differing\n      bounds.  Although this restriction  may appear to be  a severe one,\n      the experiences  we have had with Pascal tend to show that it tends\n      to  occur very  infrequently.  [...] However,  the need to  bind the\n      size  of parametric arrays  is a serious defect  in connection with\n      the use of program libraries.''\n\n\n   This  botch is the biggest  single problem with Pascal.  I believe that  if\n  it could be fixed, the  language would be an order of magnitude more usable.  \n  The proposed ISO  standard for Pascal(13) provides such a fix  (``conformant\n  array  schemas''), but  the  acceptance  of this  part  of the  standard  is\n  apparently still in doubt.\n\n\n2.2.  There are no static variables and no initialization\n    A  'static' variable  (often called  an 'own'  variable in  Algol-speaking\n  countries) is  one that  is private to  some routine and  retains its  value\n  from one call  of the routine to  the next.  De facto, Fortran variables  are\n  internal static,  except for COMMON;  in C  there is a 'static'  declaration\n  that can be  applied to local variables.  (Strictly speaking, in Fortran  77\n  one must use SAVE to force the static attribute.)\n\n    Pascal  has no such storage class.  This means that if a Pascal function or\n  procedure  intends  to  remember a  value  from  one call  to  another,  the\n  variable used must be external  to the function or procedure.  Thus it must be\n  visible to  other procedures,  and its  name must  be unique  in the  larger\n  scope.  A  simple example of  the problem is  a random number generator:  the\n  value used to compute the  current output must be saved to compute the  next\n  one, so it  must be stored in  a variable whose lifetime includes all  calls\n  of  the  random  number  generator.  In  practice,  this  is  typically  the\n  outermost block of the  program.  Thus the declaration of such a variable  is\n  far removed from the place where it is actually used.\n\n    One  example  comes from  the  text formatter  described in  Chapter 7  of\n  'Tools'.  The variable 'dir' controls  the direction from which excess blanks\n  are  inserted   during  line  justification,   to  obtain  left  and   right\n  alternately.  In Pascal, the code looks like this:\n\n\n     program formatter (...);\n\n     var\n             dir : 0..1;     { direction to add extra spaces }\n             .\n             .\n             .\n     procedure justify (...);\n     begin\n             dir := 1 - dir; { opposite direction from last time }\n             ...\n     end;\n\n             ...\n\n     begin { main routine of formatter }\n             dir := 0;\n             ...\n     end;\n\n\n  The declaration, initialization and use  of the variable 'dir' are scattered\n  all over the  program, literally hundreds of  lines apart.  In C or  Fortran,\n  'dir' can be made private to the only routine that needs to know about it:\n\n\n             ...\n     main()\n     {\n             ...\n     }\n\n             ...\n\n     justify()\n     {\n             static int dir = 0;\n\n             dir = 1 - dir;\n             ...\n     }\n\n\n    There  are of course many  other examples of the same problem on a  larger\n  scale; functions  for buffered  I/O, storage management,  and symbol  tables\n  all spring to mind.\n\n    There  are  at  least two  related problems.  Pascal  provides no  way  to\n  initialize variables  statically (i.e., at  compile time); there is  nothing\n  analogous to Fortran's DATA statement or initializers like\n\n\n     int dir = 0;\n\n\n  in C.  This means  that a  Pascal program must  contain explicit  assignment\n  statements to initialize variables (like the\n\n\n     dir := 0;\n\n\n  above).  This  code makes  the program  source text bigger,  and the  program\n  itself bigger at run time.\n\n    Furthermore,  the lack  of initializers  exacerbates the  problem of \ntoo-large  scope caused  by the  lack of  a static  storage class.  The time  to\n  initialize things  is at the  beginning, so  either the main routine  itself\n  begins with a lot of  initialization code, or it calls one or more  routines\n  to do the initializations.  In  either case, variables to be initialized must\n  be visible,  which means in  effect at the  highest level of the  hierarchy.  \n  The result is that any variable that is to be initialized has global scope.\n    The  third difficulty is that there is no way  for two routines to share a\n  variable unless  it is  declared at  or above their  least common  ancestor.  \n  Fortran COMMON and C's external  static storage class both provide a way for\n  two routines to cooperate privately,  without sharing information with their\n  ancestors.\n\n    The  new standard does not offer static variables, initialization  or\n    non-hierarchical communication.\n\n\n2.3.  Related program components must be kept separate\n    Since  the original Pascal was  implemented with a one-pass compiler,  the\n  language  believes  strongly  in  declaration  before  use.  In  particular,\n  procedures and  functions must be  declared (body  and all) before they  are\n  used.  The result is that  a typical Pascal program reads from the bottom  up\n  - all  the procedures  and functions are  displayed before any  of the  code\n  that calls them,  at all levels.  This  is essentially opposite to the  order\n  in which the functions are designed and used.\n\n    To  some extent  this can be  mitigated by a  mechanism like the  #include\n  facility of C and Ratfor:  source files can be included where needed without\n  cluttering  up  the  program.  #include  is  not  part  of  standard  Pascal,\n  although the UCB, VU and Whitesmiths compilers all provide it.\n\n    There  is also a 'forward'  declaration in Pascal that permits  separating\n  the declaration  of the function  or procedure header  from the body; it  is\n  intended  for defining  mutually  recursive  procedures.  When  the  body  is\n  declared  later on,  the header  on that  declaration may  contain only  the\n  function name, and must not repeat the information from the first instance.\n\n    A  related  problem is  that  Pascal has  a strict  order in  which it  is\n  willing to accept declarations.  Each procedure or function consists of\n\nlabel  label declarations, if any\nconst constant declarations, if any\ntype type declarations, if any\nvar variable declarations, if any\n\n          procedure and function declarations, if any\nbegin\n          body of function or procedure\nend\n\n\n  This means that all  declarations of one kind (types, for instance) must  be\n  grouped  together  for  the convenience  of  the  compiler,  even  when  the\n  programmer would like to keep  together things that are logically related so\n  as to understand the program  better.  Since a program has to be presented to\n  the compiler  all at once,  it is rarely  possible to keep the  declaration,\n  initialization and use  of types and variables close together.  Even some  of\n  the most dedicated Pascal supporters agree:(14)\n\n      ``The  inability  to  make  such  groupings  in  structuring  large\n      programs is one of Pascal's most frustrating limitations.''\n\n\n  A file inclusion facility helps only a little here.\n\n    The  new  standard  does  not  relax  the  requirements on  the  order  of\n  declarations.\n\n\n2.4.  There is no separate compilation\n    The  ``official'' Pascal language  does not provide separate  compilation,\n  and  so each  implementation  decides  on its  own  what  to do.  Some  (the\n  Berkeley interpreter,  for instance) disallow  it entirely; this is  closest\n  to the spirit  of the language and  matches the letter exactly.  Many  others\n  provide  a  declaration  that specifies  that  the  body of  a  function  is\n  externally defined.  In  any case, all such mechanisms are non-standard,  and\n  thus done differently by different systems.\n\n    Theoretically,  there  is no  need  for separate  compilation -  if  one's\n  compiler  is very  fast  (and  if the  source  for  all routines  is  always\n  available  and if  one's compiler  has  a file  inclusion  facility so  that\n  multiple  copies  of  source are  not  needed),  recompiling  everything  is\n  equivalent.  In  practice, of  course, compilers  are never  fast enough  and\n  source is often  hidden and file inclusion  is not part of the language,  so\n  changes are time-consuming.\n\n    Some  systems permit separate compilation but do not validate  consistency\n  of  types across  the boundary.  This  creates a  giant hole  in the  strong\n  typing.  (Most  other languages do  no cross-compilation checking either,  so\n  Pascal is  not inferior in  this respect.)  I have seen  at least one  paper\n  (mercifully unpublished) that  on page n castigates  C for failing to  check\n  types across  separate compilation boundaries  while suggesting on page n+1\n  that the  way to  cope with Pascal  is to compile  procedures separately  to\n  avoid type checking.\n\n    The new standard does not offer separate compilation.\n\n\n2.5.  Some miscellaneous problems of type and scope\n    Most  of the following points  are minor irritations, but I have to  stick\n  them in somewhere.\n\n    It  is not legal to name a non-basic type  as the literal formal parameter\n  of a procedure; the following is not allowed:\n\n\n     procedure add10 (var a : array [1..10] of integer);\n\n\n  Rather, one must  invent a type name,  make a type declaration, and  declare\n  the formal parameter to be an instance of that type:\n\n\n     type    a10 = array [1..10] of integer;\n     ...\n     procedure add10 (var a : a10);\n\n\n  Naturally the  type declaration is  physically separated from the  procedure\n  that uses it.  The discipline of inventing  type names is helpful for  types\n  that are used often, but it is a distraction for things used only once.\n\n    It  is  nice  to have  the  declaration  'var' for  formal  parameters  of\n  functions and  procedures; the procedure clearly  states that it intends  to\n  modify the argument.  But the calling program  has no way to declare that  a\n  variable is  to be modified  - the information is  only in one place,  while\n  two places  would be  better.  (Half  a loaf  is better than  none, though  -\n  Fortran tells the user nothing about who will do what to variables.)\n\n    It  is also a minor  bother that arrays are  passed by value by default  -\n  the  net effect  is that  every  array parameter  is declared  'var' by  the\n  programmer  more or  less  without thinking.  If  the 'var'  declaration  is\n  inadvertently omitted, the resulting bug is subtle.\n\n    Pascal's  'set' construct  seems like  a good  idea, providing  notational\n  convenience and some free type checking.  For example, a set of tests like\n\n\n     if (c = blank) or (c = tab) or (c = newline) then ...\n\n\n  can be written rather more clearly and perhaps more efficiently as\n\n\n     if c in [blank, tab, newline] then ...\n\n\n  But in practice, set types  are not useful for much more than this,  because\n  the size of a set  is strongly implementation dependent (probably because it\n  was so  in the  original CDC implementation:  59 bits).  For  example, it  is\n  natural  to   attempt  to  write   the  function  'isalphanum(c)'  (``is   c\n  alphanumeric?'') as\n\n\n     { isalphanum(c) -- true if c is letter or digit }\n     function isalphanum (c : char) : boolean;\n     begin\n             isalphanum := c in ['a'..'z', 'A'..'Z', '0'..'9']\n     end;\n\n\n  But in  many implementations of  Pascal (including  the original) this  code\n  fails because sets are just  too small.  Accordingly, sets are generally best\n  left  unused if  one  intends to  write  portable programs.  (This  specific\n  routine also runs an order  of magnitude slower with sets than with a  range\n  test or array reference.)\n\n\n2.6.  There is no escape\n    There  is no  way to override the  type mechanism when necessary,  nothing\n  analogous  to the  ``cast''  mechanism  in C.  This  means  that it  is  not\n  possible  to  write programs  like  storage  allocators or  I/O  systems  in\n  Pascal, because there is no  way to talk about the type of object  that they\n  return, and no way to  force such objects into an arbitrary type for another\n  use.  (Strictly  speaking, there is  a large  hole in the type-checking  near\n  variant records,  through which some  otherwise illegal type mismatches  can\n  be obtained.)\n\n\n3.  Control Flow\n    The  control flow  deficiencies of  Pascal are  minor but  numerous -  the\n  death of a thousand cuts, rather than a single blow to a vital spot.\n    There  is no guaranteed order of evaluation of the logical operators 'and'\n  and 'or' - nothing like  && and || in C.  \n  This failing, which  is shared with most other languages, hurts most\n often in loop control:\n\n\n     while (i <= XMAX) and (x[i] > 0) do ...\n\n\n  is extremely unwise Pascal usage,  since there is no way to ensure that i is\n  tested before x[i] is.\n\n    By  the way, the parentheses in this code are mandatory - the language has\n  only four levels of operator precedence, with relationals at the bottom.\n\n    There  is no 'break' statement for exiting loops.  This  is consistent with\n  the  one entry-one  exit philosophy  espoused  by proponents  of  structured\n  programming, but it  does lead to nasty circumlocutions or duplicated  code,\n  particularly when coupled  with the inability to control the order in  which\n  logical  expressions   are  evaluated.  Consider   this  common   situation,\n  expressed in C or Ratfor:\n\n\n     while (getnext(...)) {\n             if (something)\n                     break\n             rest of loop\n     }\n\n\n  With no 'break' statement, the first attempt in Pascal is\n\n\n     done := false;\n     while (not done) and (getnext(...)) do\n             if something then\n                     done := true\n             else begin\n                     rest of loop\n             end\n\n\n  But this doesn't work, because  there is no way to force the ``not done'' to\n  be evaluated before  the next call of  'getnext'.  This leads, after  several\n  false starts, to\n\n\n     done := false;\n     while not done do begin\n             done := getnext(...);\n             if something then\n                     done := true\n             else if not done then begin\n                     rest of loop\n             end\n     end\n\n\n  Of course recidivists can use  a 'goto' and a label (numeric only and it has\n  to be declared)  to exit a loop.  Otherwise, early exits are a pain,  almost\n  always requiring the  invention of a boolean  variable and a certain  amount\n  of cunning.  Compare finding the last non-blank in an array in Ratfor:\n\n\n     for (i = max; i > 0; i = i - 1)\n             if (arr(i) != ' ')\n                     break\n\n\n  with Pascal:\n\n\n     done := false;\n     i := max;\n     while (i > 0) and (not done) do\n             if arr[i] = ' ' then\n                     i := i - 1\n             else\n                     done := true;\n\n\n    The  index of  a 'for' loop  is undefined outside the  loop, so it is  not\n  possible to figure out whether  one went to the end or not.  The increment of\n  a 'for' loop can only be +1 or -1, a minor restriction.\n\n    There  is  no 'return'  statement,  again for  one in-one  out reasons.  A\n  function value is returned by  setting the value of a pseudo-variable (as in\n  Fortran), then falling off the  end of the function.  This sometimes leads to\n  contortions to  make sure  that all  paths actually  get to the  end of  the\n  function with the proper  value.  There is also no standard way to  terminate\n  execution except by  reaching the end of the outermost block, although  many\n  implementations provide a 'halt' that causes immediate termination.\n\n    The  'case' statement is better  designed than in C, except that there  is\n  no 'default' clause  and the behavior is  undefined if the input  expression\n  does not match  any of the cases.  This crucial omission renders the  'case'\n  construct almost worthless.  In over  6000 lines of Pascal in 'Software Tools\n  in  Pascal', I  used  it  only four  times, although  if  there had  been  a\n  'default', a 'case' would have served in at least a dozen places.\n    The new standard offers no relief on any of these points.\n\n\n4.  The Environment\n    The  Pascal run-time  environment is  relatively sparse, and  there is  no\n  extension   mechanism  except   perhaps   source-level  libraries   in   the\n  ``official'' language.\n\n    Pascal's  built-in  I/O  has  a  deservedly bad  reputation.  It  believes\n  strongly  in record-oriented  input and  output.  It also  has a  look-ahead\n  convention  that   is  hard   to  implement  properly   in  an   interactive\n  environment.  Basically, the problem is  that the I/O system believes that it\n  must read  one record ahead  of the  record that is  being processed.  In  an\n  interactive system,  this means that  when a  program is started, its  first\n  operation  is to  try to  read the  terminal for  the first  line of  input,\n  before any of the program itself has been executed.  But in the program\n\n\n     write('Please enter your name: ');\n     read(name);\n     ...\n\n\n  read-ahead causes  the program to  hang, waiting  for input before  printing\n  the prompt that asks for it.\n\n    It  is possible to escape most  of the evil effects of this I/O design  by\n  very careful implementation,  but not all Pascal  systems do so, and in  any\n  case it is relatively costly.\n\n    The  I/O design reflects the  original operating system upon which  Pascal\n  was  designed;   even  Wirth   acknowledges  that  bias,   though  not   its\n  defects.(15) It  is assumed  that text  files consist of  records, that  is,\n  lines of  text.  When  the last  character of  a line is  read, the  built-in\n  function  'eoln' becomes  true; at  that point,  one must  call 'readln'  to\n  initiate  reading a  new line  and reset  'eoln'.  Similarly,  when the  last\n  character of  the file  is read, the  built-in 'eof' becomes  true.  In  both\n  cases,  'eoln' and  'eof' must  be  tested before  each  'read' rather  than\n  after.\n\n    Given  this, considerable pains must be taken to simulate  sensible input.  \n  This implementation  of 'getc' works  for Berkeley  and VU I/O systems,  but\n  may not necessarily work for anything else:\n\n\n     { getc -- read character from standard input }\n     function getc (var c : character) : character;\n     var\n             ch : char;\n     begin\n             if eof then\n                     c := ENDFILE\n             else if eoln then begin\n                     readln;\n                     c := NEWLINE\n             end\n\n             else begin\n                     read(ch);\n                     c := ord(ch)\n             end;\n             getc := c\n     end;\n\n\n  The type 'character'  is not the same  as 'char', since ENDFILE and  perhaps\n  NEWLINE are not legal values for a 'char' variable.\n\n    There  is  no  notion  at  all of  access  to  a file  system  except  for\n  predefined files named  by (in effect) logical unit number in the  'program'\n  statement that begins  each program.  This apparently reflects the CDC  batch\n  system in which Pascal was originally developed.  A file variable\n\n\n     var fv : file of type\n\n\n  is a  very special  kind of  object -  it cannot  be assigned  to, nor  used\n  except by calls to built-in  procedures like 'eof', 'eoln', 'read', 'write',\n  'reset' and 'rewrite'.  ('reset' rewinds a file  and makes it ready for  rereading; 'rewrite' makes a file ready for writing.)\n\n    Most  implementations of Pascal provide an escape hatch to allow access to\n  files by  name from the  outside environment,  but not conveniently and  not\n  standardly.  For  example, many systems permit  a filename argument in  calls\n  to 'reset' and 'rewrite':\n\n\n     reset(fv, filename);\n\n\n  But  'reset' and  'rewrite' are  procedures,  not functions  -  there is  no\n  status return and no way  to regain control if for some reason the attempted\n  access fails.  (UCSD provides a compile-time  flag that disables the  normal\n  abort.) And since fv's cannot appear in expressions like\n\n\n     reset(fv, filename);\n     if fv = failure then ...\n\n\n  there  is no  escape in  that  direction either.  This  straitjacket makes  it\n  essentially impossible to write programs  that recover from mis-spelled file\n  names, etc.  I never solved it adequately in the 'Tools' revision.\n\n    There  is no  notion of access  to command-line arguments, again  probably\n  reflecting Pascal's  batch-processing origins.  Local  routines may allow  it\n  by adding non-standard procedures to the environment.\n\n    Since  it is not possible to write a general-purpose  storage allocator in\n  Pascal (there  being no way  to talk  about the types  that such a  function\n  would  return), the  language has  a  built-in procedure  called 'new'  that\n  allocates space from a heap.  Only defined types may be allocated, so it  is\n  not possible  to allocate,  for example,  arrays of arbitrary  size to  hold\n  character strings.  The  pointers returned by 'new' may be passed around  but\n  not manipulated: there is  no pointer arithmetic.  There is no way to  regain\n  control if storage runs out.\n    The new standard offers no change in any of these areas.\n\n\n5.  Cosmetic Issues\n    Most  of these issues are  irksome to an experienced programmer, and  some\n  are probably a nuisance even to beginners.  All can be lived with.\n\n    Pascal,  in  common with  most  other Algol-inspired  languages, uses  the\n  semicolon as  a statement separator  rather than a  terminator (as it is  in\n  PL/I and C).  As a  result one must have a reasonably sophisticated notion of\n  what a statement is to  put semicolons in properly.  Perhaps more  important,\n  if one is  serious about using them  in the proper places, a fair amount  of\n  nuisance editing is needed.  Consider the first cut at a program:\n\n\n     if a then\n             b;\n     c;\n\n\n  But if something must be  inserted before b, it no longer needs a semicolon,\n  because it now precedes an 'end':\n\n\n     if a then begin\n             b0;\n             b\n     end;\n     c;\n\n\n  Now if we add an 'else', we must remove the semicolon on the 'end':\n\n\n     if a then begin\n             b0;\n             b\n     end\n     else\n             d;\n     c;\n\n\n  And so on and so  on, with semicolons rippling up and down the program as it\n  evolves.\n\n    One  generally accepted  experimental result in  programmer psychology  is\n  that semicolon  as separator  is about ten  times more prone  to error  than\n  semicolon  as terminator.(16)  (In Ada,(17)  the  most significant  language\n  based on Pascal, semicolon is  a terminator.) Fortunately, in Pascal one can\n  almost  always  close  one's  eyes and  get  away  with  a  semicolon  as  a\n  terminator.  The exceptions  are  in  places like  declarations,  where  the\n  separator vs. terminator problem doesn't seem  as serious anyway, and  just\n  before 'else', which is easy to remember.\n    C  and Ratfor programmers find  'begin' and 'end' bulky compared to {  and\n  }.\n\n    A  function name by itself is a call of  that function; there is no way to\n  distinguish such a  function call from a  simple variable except by  knowing\n  the names  of the  functions.  Pascal uses  the Fortran trick  of having  the\n  function name act like a  variable within the function, except that where in\n  Fortran  the  function  name  really  is  a  variable,  and  can  appear  in\n  expressions,  in Pascal,  its appearance  in  an expression  is a  recursive\n  invocation: if f  is a zero-argument function, 'f:=f+1' is a recursive  call\n  of f.\n\n    There  is  a paucity  of  operators (probably  related to  the paucity  of\n  precedence levels).  In  particular, there are no bit-manipulation  operators\n  (AND,  OR, XOR,  etc.).  I simply  gave up  trying  to write  the  following\n  trivial encryption program in Pascal:\n\n\n     i := 1;\n     while getc(c) <> ENDFILE do begin\n             putc(xor(c, key[i]));\n             i := i mod keylen + 1\n     end\n\n\n  because I  couldn't write a  sensible 'xor' function.  The set types help  a\n  bit here (so  to speak), but not  enough; people who claim that Pascal is  a\n  system  programming  language  have generally  overlooked  this  point.  For\n  example, [18, p. 685]\n\n      ``Pascal  is at the  present time  [1977] the best  language in the\n      public  domain  for  purposes of  system  programming  and software\n      implementation.''\n\n  seems a bit naive.\n\n\n    There  is no  null string, perhaps because  Pascal uses the doubled  quote\n  notation to indicate a quote embedded in a string:\n\n\n     'This is a '' character'\n\n\n  There is  no way  to put  non-graphic symbols  into strings.  In fact,  non-graphic characters  are unpersons in  a stronger  sense, since they are  not\n  mentioned in  any part  of the  standard language.  Concepts like  newlines,\n  tabs, and so  on are handled on  each system in an 'ad hoc' manner,  usually\n  by  knowing something  about  the character  set  (e.g., ASCII  newline  has\n  decimal value 10).\n\n    There  is no macro processor.  The 'const' mechanism for  defining manifest\n  constants takes  care of  about 95  percent of  the uses  of simple  #define\n  statements  in C,  but more  involved  ones are  hopeless.  It is  certainly\n  possible to put a  macro preprocessor on a Pascal compiler.  This allowed  me\n  to simulate a sensible 'error' procedure as\n\n\n     #define error(s)begin writeln(s); halt end\n\n\n  ('halt' in  turn might be defined  as a branch to  the end of the  outermost\n  block.) Then calls like\n\n     error('little string');\n     error('much bigger string');\n\n\n  work  since 'writeln'  (as  part of  the  standard Pascal  environment)  can\n  handle strings of any size.  It is unfortunate that there is no way  to make\n  this convenience available to routines in general.\n\n    The  language prohibits expressions in declarations, so it is not possible\n  to write things like\n\n\n      const   SIZE = 10;\n      type    arr = array [1..SIZE+1] of integer;\n\n\n  or even simpler ones like\n\n\n      const   SIZE = 10;\n              SIZE1 = SIZE + 1;\n\n6.  Perspective\n    The  effort to rewrite the programs in 'Software Tools'  started in March,\n  1980,  and, in  fits  and  starts, lasted  until  January, 1981.  The  final\n  product(19)  was published  in  June, 1981.  During  that time  I  gradually\n  adapted to  most of  the superficial  problems with  Pascal (cosmetics,  the\n  inadequacies  of control  flow), and  developed imperfect  solutions to  the\n  significant ones (array sizes, run-time environment).\n\n    The  programs  in  the book  are  meant  to be  complete,  well-engineered\n  programs that do  non-trivial tasks.  But they  do not have to be  efficient,\n  nor are their interactions with  the operating system very complicated, so I\n  was able  to get  by with  some pretty  kludgy solutions,  ones that  simply\n  wouldn't work for real programs.\n\n    There  is no significant way  in which I found  Pascal superior to C,  but\n  there are several places  where it is a clear improvement over Ratfor.  Most\n  obvious by far is recursion:  several programs are much cleaner when written\n  recursively,   notably  the   pattern-search,  quicksort,   and   expression\n  evaluation.\n\n    Enumeration  data types  are a good  idea.  They simultaneously delimit  the\n  range  of legal  values and  document them.  Records help  to group  related\n  variables.  I found relatively little use for pointers.\n\n    Boolean  variables are  nicer than  integers for  Boolean conditions;  the\n  original  Ratfor programs  contained  some unnatural  constructions  because\n  Fortran's logical variables are badly designed.\n\n    Occasionally  Pascal's type checking would  warn of a slip of the hand  in\n  writing a  program; the run-time  checking of  values also indicated  errors\n  from time to time, particularly subscript range violations.\n\n    Turning  to the negative side, recompiling a large program from scratch to\n  change a single line of  source is extremely tiresome; separate compilation,\n  with or without type checking, is mandatory for large programs.\n\n    I  derived little benefit from the fact that characters are part of Pascal\n  and not part  of Fortran, because the  Pascal treatment of strings and \n  non-graphics is so  inadequate.  In both languages,  it is appallingly clumsy  to\n  initialize literal strings  for tables of keywords, error messages, and  the\n  like.\n\n    The  finished programs  are in  general about  the same  number of  source\n  lines as  their Ratfor  equivalents.  At  first this surprised  me, since  my\n  preconception was  that Pascal is  a wordier  and less expressive  language.\n  The real  reason seems to  be that  Pascal permits arbitrary expressions  in\n  places like  loop limits  and subscripts  where Fortran  (that is,  portable\n  Fortran  66)  does not,  so  some  useless assignments  can  be  eliminated;\n  furthermore,  the Ratfor  programs declare  functions while  Pascal ones  do\n  not.\n\n\n    To close, let me summarize the main points in the case against Pascal.\n\n  Since  the size of an array is  part of its type, it is not possible  to\n      write  general-purpose  routines,  that  is,  to  deal  with  arrays  of\n      different sizes.  In particular, string handling is very difficult.\n\n  The  lack of static variables,  initialization and a way to  communicate\n      non-hierarchically  combine to destroy the  ``locality'' of a program  -\n      variables require much more scope than they ought to.\n\n  The one-pass  nature of the language forces procedures and functions  to\n      be presented  in an unnatural order; the enforced separation of  various\n      declarations   scatters   program  components   that  logically   belong\n      together.\n\n  The  lack  of  separate compilation  impedes  the development  of  large\n      programs and makes the use of libraries impossible.\n\n  The  order of logical expression evaluation cannot be controlled,  which\n      leads to convoluted code and extraneous variables.\n\n  The 'case' statement is emasculated because there is no default clause.\n\n  The  standard  I/O is  defective.  There  is  no sensible  provision  for\n      dealing  with  files  or  program  arguments  as part  of  the  standard\n      language, and no extension mechanism.\n\n  The  language  lacks  most of  the  tools  needed for  assembling  large\n      programs, most notably file inclusion.\n\n  There is no escape.\n\n\n    This  last point is perhaps the most important.  The language is inadequate\n  but circumscribed, because there is  no way to escape its limitations.  There\n  are no casts  to disable the type-checking  when necessary.  There is no  way\n  to replace  the defective run-time environment  with a sensible one,  unless\n  one  controls the  compiler that  defines the  ``standard procedures.''  The\n  language is closed.\n\n    People  who use  Pascal for serious  programming fall into  a fatal  trap.\n  Because the  language is so  impotent, it must  be extended.  But each  group\n  extends Pascal in its own  direction, to make it look like whatever language\n  they really want.  Extensions for  separate compilation, Fortran-like COMMON,\n  string  data  types,   internal  static  variables,  initialization,   octal\n  numbers, bit  operators, etc., all  add to the  utility of the language  for\n  one group, but destroy its portability to others.\n\n    I  feel that it is  a mistake to use  Pascal for anything much beyond  its\n  original target.  In  its pure form, Pascal  is a toy language, suitable  for\n  teaching but not for real programming.\n\n\nAcknowledgments\n\n    I  am  grateful to  Al  Aho, Al  Feuer, Narain  Gehani,  Bob Martin,  Doug\n  McIlroy, Rob Pike,\n  Dennis Ritchie,\n  Chris Van Wyk and Charles Wetherell  for\n  helpful criticisms of earlier versions of this paper.\n\n[1]Feuer,  A.

We and some\nothers think there are currently two aspects of WireGuard that make\nits deployment in a privacy-focused setting a bit challenging. The\ngoal of this email is to present current thoughts on the issues and\nfacilitate discussion. It contains language and ideas from others who\nhave commented on this elsewhere. Thank you. Feel free to make\nyourselves known. Any errors are mine however.\n\nThe two issues are:\n* WireGuard does not offer identity hiding forward secrecy\n* WireGuard does not offer dynamic IP address assignment\n\nTogether with other interested parties I hope to arrive at a good\nsolution to these issues, which can be adopted by any apps that want\nto offer privacy. The time to do this is now, before WireGuard reaches\nmassive adoption and multiple incompatible hacks are made.\n\nYou might care about this if you:\n* Run a VPN proxy/server where you or your users care about privacy\n* Use a commercial VPN service\n* Provide a commercial VPN service\n\n\n-WireGuard does not offer identity hiding forward secrecy-\n\n--The problem--\nIn the context of a VPN service the peers can be viewed as Client(s)\nand Server. A key compromise of the VPN server's static private key\nmakes an attacker able to decrypt recorded handshakes and thus\ncorrelate all connections made using any given client static key, i.e.\nVPN user. Here's how:\n\n1. An attacker records encrypted traffic flows to/from a VPN server.\n\n2. Time passes. The attacker gets hold of the VPN server's static\nprivate key, by raiding a data centre, breaking into a VPN server\nhost, or something else.\n\n3. The attacker uses the VPN server static private key to decrypt the\nrecorded handshakes, revealing client static pubkeys.\n\n4. The attacker uses client static pubkeys to correlate traffic flows\nwith particular users including possibly linking individuals to client\npubkeys through other data sources, e.g. VPN provider business records\nor other IP address metadata.\n\n--Nuances--\nA successful attack requires both the capability to record traffic\nflows as well as to compromise the server key. Still, the lack of\nidentity hiding forward secrecy means WireGuard offers worse privacy\nthan e.g. OpenVPN in this respect.\n\nIt should be noted that both WireGuard and OpenVPN send tunnel session\nIDs in the clear. A user that roams between networks will probably\nleak the session ID between them. On the other hand, a user that\nexplicitly disconnects on network 1 and reconnects the VPN tunnel on\nnetwork 2 will have a new tunnel session ID that is not linkable to\nthe first one. In this case OpenVPN (assuming user/pass auth and not\nclient-cert) will have identity hiding forward secrecy, and WireGuard\ndoes not.\n\nIf a WireGuard user application connects with a new pubkey every time\na new tunnel is established, it will provide the same identity hiding\nproperties as OpenVPN. However depending on the position of the\nsurveillance equipment and the method of key compromise neither\nOpenVPN nor WireGuard would be sufficient protection. That's\nout-of-scope for this discussion however.\n\n--Proposed mitigation--\nIn order to get identity hiding forward secrecy the suggestion is to\nhave the client change its static pubkey often in order to de-link VPN\nsessions, in the event of a compromise of the server's static private\nkey. “Often” might be a time limit, a bandwidth limit, and events like\nreboot of the system, the app, new WiFi, new DHCP lease, or explicitly\nby the user. To provide the same properties as OpenVPN it should be\nenough to change pubkey every time the user does a connect/disconnect.\n\nThis should probably be a functionality on top of WireGuard, which\nshould stay minimal. It should be possible for clients to register new\nstatic pubkeys with the VPN service and to ask it to forget about old\npubkeys. One current idea is to define a service on top of WireGuard\nrunning as a daemon on both client and server, communicating over a\nWireGuard session.\n\n\n-WireGuard does not offer dynamic IP address assignment-\n\n--The problem--\nThe tunnel-internal IP address can leak through WebRTC and perhaps\nother ways. A long term IP address assignment could enable a website\nthat exfiltrates the IP address to use it as a unique identifier\nbetween website visits, even if the user has cleared all browsing\ndata. There are other ways of doing this.\n\nA perhaps more serious consequence of static assignment is that the IP\naddress is stored linked to a user's static public key, which in turn\nmight be linked to a user’s personal identity through the server’s\nauthentication system. If the attacker learns the IP address as well\nas gains access to the user database, it might be able to link the IP\naddress to a person.\n\nIn a commercial VPN service setup, the IP address and thus its static\npublic key are probably linked to a customer account, and to payment\ninformation. If this is the case, an attacker might be able to\nidentify the user. There are various mitigations and hacks one could\ndo as an operator to prevent this. Regardless, an approach to\nephemeral IP addresses that is accepted as standard would be\npreferable.\n\n--Proposed mitigation--\nMake it possible for clients to request a dynamically assigned IP\naddress from the VPN server. One idea is to define a service on top of\nWireGuard running as a daemon on both client and server, communicating\nover a WireGuard session. The client would need a statically assigned\nlink-local IPv6 address and use that to communicate with the\nserver-side daemon, which then assigns an IP address dynamically.\n\n\n-What's been done already?-\n\nAn effort has already started regarding the dynamic IP addresses. Read\nthe following for more info:\nhttps://www.wireguard.com/todo/\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/11RJDDrdIsnGivz8xP5NsOteHdviuV4jfNG1CSl0q8cY/edit\nhttps://git.zx2c4.com/wg-dynamic\n\nOne issue with an in-tunnel daemon is authentication of client and\nserver. It’s possible the client side of the WireGuard tunnel is\nactually a router for many more clients, who probably shouldn’t be\nauthorized to renegotiate the router’s dynamic IP address or pubkey.\nAn alternative to an in-tunnel daemon would be to use peer-addressed\ndatagrams for control messages instead, but that introduces other\ncomplexities as mentioned in the documents above.\n\n\n-Summary-\nA privacy-focused deployment of WireGuard should provide identity\nhiding forward secrecy and short-term dynamic IP address assignment.\nWireGuard provides neither, since it's out-of-scope for the project's\ngoals, for good reasons. One solution would be to define a service\nthat communicates over a WireGuard tunnel. The same service could\nprovide API calls for both needs, as well as other things.\n\nFinally, it would be good if the mechanism and protocol remained the\nsame regardless of if one was connecting to a lone WireGuard server,\nor to a WireGuard server in a network of many, such as a large VPN\nservice provider. I for one expect WireGuard to become the standard\nVPN protocol for VPN services within a few years, and that they will\ncontinue to grow until then. To my knowledge the largest ones today\nrun almost 10,000 servers.\n\n\nThank you for your time.\n\nBest regards,\nFredrik Stromberg\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious message: Support ip6tables-like network masks for allowed-ips besides CIDR\n\nNext message: WireGuard deployment considerations for improved privacy\n\n Messages sorted by:\n[ date ]\n[ thread ]\n[ subject ]\n[ author ]\n\n\n\nMore information about the WireGuard\nmailing list\n", "url": "https://lists.zx2c4.com/pipermail/wireguard/2019-January/003777.html", "hostname": "lists.zx2c4.com", "category": "uncategorized", "comment_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19244283"}, {"title": "WireGuard – Apps on Google Play", "description": "This is a simple app for managing WireGuard VPN tunnels.", "url": "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wireguard.android&hl=en_SG", "hostname": "play.google.com", "category": "uncategorized", "comment_url": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19243390"}, {"title": "WireGuard VPN: What You Need to Know - NOT (Yet) Recommended", "description": "WireGuard is an interesting new VPN protocol that has the potential to bring major change to the VPN industry.

A small\ncommercial VPN provider approached me recently about the fact they could see\nthe allowed IPs mapping easily with WireGuard, whereas with OpenVPN it was\nhidden deep inside a process they didn't know how to debug. \"Great,\" I\nthought. Not so fast. They were concerned that when compelled to retrieve this\nkind of information, they would no longer be able to claim, \"we don't know\nhow,\" since WireGuard makes it so easy. So, they hired me for a day to develop\nand open source a small solution for their unique use case and odd scenario.\n\nBefore reading further, do you have the same bizarre requirement? Probably\nnot. In that likely case, please keep reading only under the scope of,\n\"something somebody else thought they needed, but I don't need myself.\" In\nother words, don't use this code.\n\nNot wanting to hack up WireGuard or add configuration nobs -- or really\ncompromise any of what the project is about in response to these kinds of\nrequests -- I thought I'd write a small \"defensive rootkit,\" which most\ncertainly kills both your kitten and your neighbor's parrot.\n\nIt started out by just hooking the Netlink API to zero out the endpoints and\nallowedips for each peer. Then I disabled tcpdump. Then I disabled /dev/mem,\n/dev/kmem, /dev/port, /proc/kcore, and module loading. Things were looking\nfairly clean, until I needed to add compatibility support for old kernels, and\nthen I reverted to some cthulhu-style x86 opcode parsing and writing to proc\nfrom kernelspace and other atrocities. It seems to work relatively well on\nthe kernels I've tested, but of course there are no guarantees with this kind\nof stuff. In any case, there aren't very many public rootkit examples like\nthis, so at the very least it might be an aid to a college freshman doing an\nassignment for his \"Intro to Computer Security\" course.\n\nKeep in mind that there are several ways to subvert each and every defense\nthat this thing introduces. Several ways! All of the defenses! Subverted! For\nthat reason, you shouldn't use this if you're relying on the impossibility of\nsubversion. It's only meant as a confinement based on your own lack of\nknowledge on how to subvert it. As you learn more, the software becomes less\neffective.\n\nIf it's of any interest, it's online here:\nhttps://git.zx2c4.com/blind-operator-mode/about/\nhttps://git.zx2c4.com/blind-operator-mode/tree/blind-operator-mode.c\n$ git clone https://git.zx2c4.com/blind-operator-mode/\n\nEnjoy!
